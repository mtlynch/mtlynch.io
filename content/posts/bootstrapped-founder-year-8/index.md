Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I sold my first profitable business, so I've been trying to figure out.

## Aligning my skills with my business

One of the hardest things I've found about being an indie founder is creating a business that aligns my skills with

In my first year, I became interested in the keto diet and noticed all the websites related to the keto diet were crappy. They were just generic WordPress sites, so I thought, "I'm a programmer. I can make a keto website that's better than all these diet bloggers!"

Two problems:

1. I had basically zero experience with web programming, so my keto websites were also pretty bad.
1. The people making money

I felt like the business didn't align with my skills. Oh, wow, everyone else is just running WordPress sites. I can outcompete them by making a site that's exactly what I want. Except I wasn't that good at making websites, and efficient web performance wasn't much of a competitive advantage in a business that exists just to attract visitors and generate ad dollars.

TinyPilot was a little better. I cared about the product because it was something I used. When I wrote about homelab stuff, it attracted customers. But over time, I just didn't have enough time to write because I was juggling to many complexities of running a hardware business. And when I did have time to write, the impact was just within the noise. When the business has $70-110k/month sales, a fun blog post isn't really tipping the scales.

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

- HN Popularity Contest
- Editing, including helping Tyler Cipriani reach #1 on Hacker News

Wrote more than I ever have before:

- 150 pages of my book (plus a lot more that I cut)
- XX blog post (XX on my personal blog and YY on my book website)
- 12 monthly retrospectives
- XX notes (shorter, less polished blog posts)

## A year of existential angst

In some ways, it's great. There's sort of competition among AI vendors. At least better competition than in the mobile OS market or the XX market.

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#goals-for-next-year) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:
