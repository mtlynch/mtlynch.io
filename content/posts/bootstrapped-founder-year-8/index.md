Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I [sold my first profitable business](/i-sold-tinypilot/) and became a father (TODO: link), so I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make money and balance my work with family time.

## How finances went

People are always most interested in how the money works, so I'll start there. Here's what my revenue and profit looked like every month.

<canvas id="monthly-finances-chart"></canvas>

In total, I had $8.2k in profit on $16.3k in revenue. That was my total income for the year, which is obviously not enough to support a family, but my wife also works, and we have savings.

My main source of revenue was my book. I'm writing a book to teach developers to improve their writing. I did a Kickstarter for it in March, which gave me [$6k in pre-sales](/my-6k-advance/). As I wrote, I continued to sell discounted early access to the book. In total, XX readers purchased early access to the book, for which I'm grateful. I also have an [old business](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/#zestful) that makes $100-200/month without me touching it.

My main expenses were LLMs, XX, and XX. I don't use AI to write, but I use it for a lot of the accessory tasks like making supporting web apps. And also just fun experiments.

Here's how 2025 compared to previous years:

<canvas id="annual-finances-chart"></canvas>

The years I was running TinyPilot dominate the chart. Still, 2025 was my fourth most profitable year as a founder.

My goal for the year was $50k in profit, so I fell quite short.

The book took longer to write than I expected. I thought I'd complete the book by August and have time to try several software businesses alongside the book. Instead, I spent all my time on the book, and I'm still not done.

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

When I tell other software developers that I'm writing a book, they usually say something like, "Oh, great!" And then they pause, a little confused, "To give you time for freelance dev work?" And I have to say, "No, I'm _just_ writing a book. That's my whole job."

When I tell friends and family I'm working on a book, they say, "Oh, so you're still on paternity leave?"

No! I'm writing a book. It's a real job!

But if I'm being honest, I understand their confusion. How can writing a book be my job? I'm not a professional author. And why has it taken me more than a year to write a non-fiction book?

When I started the book, I thought I'd be done in six months. I typically write a short book's worth of blog posts per year, and that's just from writing for an hour a day. If I have nothing to do but write a book, I should be done in 1/8th the time!

It turns out that even when all I have to do is write, I can still only write for about an hour per day before I feel drained.

I also can't _just_ write a book. I need to find people to actually read the book, so I also wrote blog posts and published chapter excerpts. I ended up writing far more in the past year than I ever have before:

- 13 blog posts (8 on [my personal blog](/posts/) and 5 on [my book's blog](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/))
- 12 [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/)
- 12 [notes](/notes/) (shorter, less polished blog posts)
- 150 pages of my book, including seven chapters I adapted into [free excerpts](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/)

I spent a lot of time editing blog posts for other developers. That helped me discover other developers' writing pain points and what advice they found effective. I worked with XX clients, and in the process [helped Tyler Cipriani](https://refactoringenglish.com/services/blog-editing/sample-future-of-git/) reach [#1 on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44916783).

And then there's just a bunch of administrative tasks around writing and selling a book like setting up mailing lists, dealing with Stripe, debugging PDF/epub rendering issues, etc. (TODO: links)

## Finding alignment with my business

This has been my favorite year of being a founder since I went off on my own eight years ago. It took me several years to figure out that I feel most fulfilled when I'm doing something that ticks all of these boxes:

1. I enjoy doing it
1. I do it well
1. It earns money
1. It facilitates work-life balance
1. It serves my users

This is similar to the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which founders have started talking about the last few years.

As a concrete example, one of my first businesses back in 2019 was a website called Is It Keto. It was a simple website that explained why certain foods did or did not fit the keto diet.

Here's how Is It Keto scored on my rubric:

| Enjoyment         | 🔴    | I enjoyed programming but didn't care about the keto diet.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Competence        | 🔴    | I wasn't good at building websites, finding users, or convincing anyone to buy things.                                                                                                                      |
| Profitability     | 🔴    | The site was [not profitable](/retrospectives/2020/07/#is-it-keto).                                                                                                                                         |
| Work-Life balance | 🟢    | The site was easy to keep online 24/7. Even if there had been an outage, the stakes were so low that I'd only be losing a few dollars of ad revenue per day.                                                |
| Utility to users  | 🟡    | Users found it useful, but I only made money if users clicked ads or ordered keto products online. They probably would have been better off buying [real food](https://realfood.gov/) at the grocery store. |     |

Writing my book, everything feels a lot more aligned with what I'm interested in and what I'm good at, though I'm still working on the money and utility parts:

| Enjoyment         | 🟢    | I'm passionate about clear writing and enjoy teaching techniques to other developers.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Competence        | 🟢    | I feel especially qualified to write about clear writing for software developers I've been blogging for several years, and writing played a key role in all of my businesses.                                                                                  |
| Profitability     | 🟡    | I've made $XXk from pre-sales which feels good for a first-time author, but it's not yet profitable enough to be sustainable.                                                                                                                                  |
| Work-Life balance | 🟢    | Few businesses beat an ebook in terms work-life balance. I can comfortably step away from the book and ignore emails for weeks without it bothering anyone. I've never been paged at 2 AM because my servers are down and users urgently need to read my book. |
| Utility to users  | 🟡    | I hear positive things about the book from readers as they read new chapters, but I want to make sure readers are getting tangible results (e.g., they're getting better feedback or results on their own writing) from the book and not just pseudolearning.  |

A book is extremely friendly to work-life balance. Nobody's ever paged me at 2 AM to say that says my servers are down, and customers are panicking because they can't read my book.

## Can I succeed again?

Making $XX on a book is pretty good for a first-time author, but it's obviously not a sustainable income, so one of the questions I've been asking myself a lot this year is: can I create a successful business again?

When I went off on my own, I thought, "What's the worst that could happen? I just go get another software job." With today's software job market, I'm not even sure that safety net exists for me anymore. And even if it does, I'd feel crushed having a boss that expects me to do profitable things rather than blog about [why I hate the passive voice](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/passive-voice-considered-harmful/).

With TinyPilot, I made money, but I also got incredibly lucky in a lot of ways.

There were probably 100 catastrophes that could have occurred to sink the company, and I'm fortunate to live one of the few timelines where none of them occurred. it took me XX years to become reach profitability.

Even the product itself, it wasn't like I recognized that COVID would drive increased demand in remote administration devices and smartly jumped on the opportunity. It was just dumb luck that I happened to be tinkering with something that the market wanted.

I actually have a lot of optimism. It feels like the stars have aligned again to give me an unfair advantage:

- There are an enormous number of useful software products that are now viable to create using AI that would have been too costly to implement before.
- AI is extremely powerful, but it's still at the stage where the only people who can use it to its full potential are senior-level generalist software engineers.
- Other senior software developers who could use AI to build companies either lack motivation or experience in entrepreneurship, whereas I have eight years of experience.

Cloud computing increased the power of a single engineer. To deploy a production-grade web app, you no longer needed a server admin and a software developer: you could just have the . With AI, you can get specialty expertise without hiring an expert. I know I'm not going to have AI. Four years ago, when I wanted to add H.264 video encoding to my app, I had to find an engineer with video encoding experience to implement it. I think I spent $3-5k to show a proof of concept just because nobody on the team was familiar with the APIs. It would have been even more expensive to But today, that's the kind of thing I could just

I did a Kickstarter for the book, and it succeeded by a hair.

## Do I still love it?

At the end of [my first year as a founder](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/), I wrote:

> As someone who has always valued independence, I love being a solo developer. It makes a world of difference to wake up whenever I want and make my own choices about how to spend my entire day.
>
> ...
>
> My friends with children tell me that kids won't complicate this at all.

I wrote that in 2019, when I was in my early thirties and single.

A few weeks later, I met my wife, and we've been together ever since. We had our first child in 2024. And, surprisingly, my life is still how I described it seven years ago.

Okay, my life isn't _exactly_ what I described in 2019. My toddler decides when I wake up, and it's not always the time his independence-loving father would choose. But I still feel the joy of spending my work days on whatever I choose.

I joked back then about how much kids would complicate my life as an indie founder, but it's actually less complicated than I expected. Plus, it's more fun. My wife and I work from home, and our families come over to do childcare during working hours. Anytime I want, I can take a break from work to go play with my son.

After several years of [just "enjoying" life](/bootstrapped-founder-year-6/#do-i-still-love-it) as a bootstrapped founder, I'm happy to say that I love it again. I still want to do it forever.

## Lessons learned

### Writing a book takes longer than you expect

This is kind of an extension of [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

> Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#goals-for-next-year) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Earn $50k in profit

- **Result**: I earned $8.2k in profit.
- **Grade**: D

TODO

### Publish a course or book

- **Result**: I'm about 80% done with my book.
- **Grade**: C

TODO

### Learn a new programming language

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

## Goals for next year

### Earn five book citations

I'd like to find successful developer authors who publicly cite my book as a resource that helped them achieve something.

### Earn $75k in profit

### Create a profitable software business
