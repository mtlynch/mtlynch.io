Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I sold my first profitable business, so I've been trying to figure out how to

Mostly from pre-sales for my book. I still have one customer of Zestful that pays me $150-250/month to keep the service going.

## Can I succeed again?

Making $XX on a book is pretty good for a first-time author, but it's obviously not a sustainable income, so one of the things on my mind a lot this year is: can I create a successful business again?

When I went off on my own, I thought, "What's the worst that could happen? I just go get another software job." With today's software job market, I'm not even sure that safety net exists for me anymore. And even if it does, I'd feel crushed having a boss that expects me to do profitable things rather than blog about why I hate the passive voice.

**Note**: If you're an employer reading my blog because I've folded and applied for a job, the preceding paragraph was a joke. I love being managed, no matter how dumb the boss or wrongheaded the project. I certainly will never long for the freedom of self-employment.

With TinyPilot, I made money, but I also got incredibly lucky in a lot of ways.

There were probably 100 catastrophes that could have occurred to sink the company, and I'm fortunate to live one of the few timelines where none of them occurred. it took me XX years to become reach profitability.

Even the product itself, it wasn't like I recognized that COVID would drive increased demand in remote administration devices and smartly jumped on the opportunity. It was just dumb luck that I happened to be tinkering with something that the market wanted.

I actually have a lot of optimism. It feels like the stars have aligned again to give me an unfair advantage:

- There are an enormous number of useful software products that are now viable to create using AI that would have been too costly to implement before.
- AI is extremely powerful, but it's still at the stage where the only people who can use it to its full potential are senior-level generalist software engineers.
- Other senior software developers who could use AI to build companies either lack motivation or experience in entrepreneurship, whereas I have eight years of experience.

Cloud computing increased the power of a single engineer. To deploy a production-grade web app, you no longer needed a server admin and a software developer: you could just have the . With AI, you can get specialty expertise without hiring an expert. I know I'm not going to have AI. Four years ago, when I wanted to add H.264 video encoding to my app, I had to find an engineer with video encoding experience to implement it. I think I spent $3-5k to show a proof of concept just because nobody on the team was familiar with the APIs. It would have been even more expensive to But today, that's the kind of thing I could just

I did a Kickstarter for the book, and it succeeded by a hair.

## Finding alignment with my business

This has been my favorite year of being a founder since I went off on my own eight years ago.

The major reason is finding alignment between these things:

1. What I enjoy doing
1. What I do well
1. What serves my users
1. What earns money

This is similar to the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which founders have started talking about the last few years.

For contrast, one of the first businesses I created was a website called Is It Keto. It explained why certain foods did or did not fit the keto diet

- Enjoyment: I didn't care about the keto diet.
- Competence: I wasn't good at finding users or convincing them to buy things.
- Profitability: The site was not profitable.
- User-founder alignment: I made money if users clicked ads and ordered keto products online, but they would have been better off buying [real food](https://realfood.gov/) at the grocery store.

Writing my book, everything just feels aligned with what I'm interested in and what I'm good at:

- Enjoyment: I'm passionate about clear writing and enjoy teaching techniques to other developers.
- Competence: I feel especially qualified to write about clear writing for software developers I've been blogging for several years, and writing played a key role in all of my businesses.
- Profitability: I've made $XXk from pre-sales which is not profitable enough to be sustainable.
- User-founder alignment: I find readers for the book by publishing blog posts about the things I'm interested in. People who read my writing get something useful even if they have no interest in my book.

I'm not totally nailing the "money" pillar. And I feel like I'm doing well, but I definitely want to improve. I'll feel more confident I'm succeeding if I hear readers tell me that my book has helped them and gotten results (e.g., they're getting better feedback on their documentation or blog posts)

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

When I tell people that I'm writing a book, they're usually a bit confused. They ask something like, "Oh, like to give you time for freelance dev work?" And I have to be like, "No, I'm just writing a book. That's all I'm doing."

But honestly, I'm surprised at how long it's taking me to write this book.

I typically write about 10 full-length blog posts per year, by writing for about an hour a day. And a book is like 10-12 blog posts, so if I just write a book instead of a blog, I should be done in about a year. Except, it should be even faster because I only spend about an hour a day on my blog, so if I have eight hours to write, I could write a book in a few months.

It turns out that even if I spend all day writing, I can still only write for about an hour a day. After that, I feel too tired and unfocused.

The other thing is that I can't _just_ write my book. I also need to do things to try to find readers for my book, both so I can actually make money from it and so I can get feedback to know whether I'm writing something useful.

Wrote more than I ever have before:

- 150 pages of my book (plus a lot more that I cut)
- 13 blog posts (8 on [my personal blog](/posts/) and 5 on [my book's blog](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/))
- 12 [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/)
- 12 [notes](/notes/) (shorter, less polished blog posts)

## Do I still love it?

My favorite year. Aligning the things I like. And my wife and I work from home, and our families help out with childcare during the day, so anytime I want, I can take a break to go play with my son.

At the end of [my first year as a founder](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/), I wrote:

> As someone who has always valued independence, I love being a solo developer. It makes a world of difference to wake up whenever I want and make my own choices about how to spend my entire day.
>
> ...
>
> My friends with children tell me that kids won't complicate this at all.

When I wrote that, I was single. I met my wife a few weeks after publishing that, and we had our first child in 2024. It's surprising that it's still true.

Kids and a family mean I can't do whatever I want _all_ day, but I still feel like I do whatever I want from 9-5 every day.

That's still pretty true.

A book is extremely friendly to work-life balance. Nobody's ever paged me at 2 AM to say that says my servers are down, and customers are panicking because they can't read my book.

And even my work setup is super nice. My family comes over to help out with childcare while my wife and I work, so whenever I want a break from work, I get to play with my son, and he's always delighted to see me.

## Lessons learned

### Writing a book takes longer than you expect

This is kind of an extension of [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

> Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

## Grading last year's goals

### Earn $50k in profit

- **Result**: Earned $XXk in profit
- **Grade**: D

TODO

### Publish a course or book

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

### Learn a new programming language

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

## Goals for next year

### Earn five positive citations of my book

I'd like to find successful developer authors who publicly cite my book as a resource that helped them achieve something.

### Earn $75k in profit
