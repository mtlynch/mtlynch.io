Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I sold my first profitable business, so I've been trying to figure out how to

## How finances went

TODO: Graph of revenue / profit for the year

Mostly from pre-sales for my book. I still have one customer of Zestful that pays me $150-250/month to keep the service going.

## Aligning my skills with my business

Back when I first started as a founder, all of my business ideas were in domains I didn't care about. For example, I created a site to help beginners with the keto diet even though I was only mildly interested in the diet myself.

I thought

In my first year, I became interested in the keto diet and noticed all the websites related to the keto diet were crappy. They were just generic WordPress sites, so I thought, "I'm a programmer. I can make a keto website that's better than all these diet bloggers!"

Two problems:

1. I had basically zero experience with web programming, so my keto websites were also pretty bad.
1. The people making money

I felt like the business didn't align with my skills. Oh, wow, everyone else is just running WordPress sites. I can outcompete them by making a site that's exactly what I want. Except I wasn't that good at making websites, and efficient web performance wasn't much of a competitive advantage in a business that exists just to attract visitors and generate ad dollars.

TinyPilot was a little better. I cared about the product because it was something I used. When I wrote about homelab stuff, it attracted customers. But over time, I just didn't have enough time to write because I was juggling to many complexities of running a hardware business. And when I did have time to write, the impact was just within the noise. When the business has $70-110k/month sales, a fun blog post isn't really tipping the scales.

## Can I succeed again?

I did a Kickstarter for the book, and it succeeded by a hair.

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

When I tell people that I'm writing a book, they don't understand. They ask something like, "Oh, like to give you time for freelance dev work?" And I have to be like, "No, I'm just writing a book. That's all I'm doing."

But honestly, I'm surprised at how long it's taking me to write this book.

I typically write about 10 full-length blog posts per year, by writing for about an hour a day. And a book is like 10-12 blog posts, so if I just write a book instead of a blog, I should be done in about a year. Except, it should be even faster because I only spend about an hour a day on my blog, so if I have eight hours to write, I could write a book in a few months.

It turns out that even if I spend all day writing, I can still only write for about an hour a day. After that, I feel too tired and unfocused.

The other thing is that I can't _just_ write my book. I also need to do things to try to find readers for my book, both so I can actually make money from it and so I can get feedback to know whether I'm writing something useful.

Wrote more than I ever have before:

- 150 pages of my book (plus a lot more that I cut)
- 13 blog posts (8 on [my personal blog](/posts/) and 5 on [my book's blog](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/))
- 12 [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/)
- 12 [notes](/notes/) (shorter, less polished blog posts)

## Finding a balance with AI

I would still describe my usage of AI to program as mostly "begrudging" but I've found a balance where I can enjoy what AI replaces for me without getting lost in resentment toward AI for doing something I liked (and stealing everyone's work to do it).

When I first started using AI, it felt like a slight productivity boost but it wasn't anything Earth-changing. I enjoy programming and didn't like the idea of.

I was also surprised to discover how often I actually don't care about the code. If it works and matches my expectations, I don't need to read the code. I don't do this for high-stakes things, but for creating a visualization, I don't read the code if the visualization looks right.

As LLMs have improved, they've gotten better than me at a lot of things. And suddenly in the last month, everyone is excited about LLM sandboxes, and I've embraced that. I'd always micromanaged my LLMs because I didn't want to let them run wild on my system. But in a sandbox, I don't care, and I can shift more work onto the LLMs, which makes a surprising amount of difference.

It replaces things I dislike:

- Reading API documentation
- Searching through forum posts

- Port my old site from a Vue SPA to a simpler vanilla HTML site generated with Hugo
- Generate visualizations from this raw data
- Replace the Bulma CSS library with Bootstrap
- Figure out how to build this open-source repo from source and capture it in a Nix flake

I found it joyless.

## Do I still love it?

My favorite year. Aligning the things I like. And my wife and I work from home, and our families help out with childcare during the day, so anytime I want, I can take a break to go play with my son.
