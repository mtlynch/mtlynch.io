Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I [sold my first profitable business](/i-sold-tinypilot/) and became a father (TODO: link), so I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make money and balance my work with family time.

## How finances went

People are always most interested in how the money works, so I'll start there. Here's what my revenue and profit looked like every month.

In total, I had $8.2k in profit on $16.3k in revenue. That was my total income for the year, which is obviously not enough to support a family, but my wife also works, and we have savings.

My main source of revenue was my book. I'm writing a book to teach developers to improve their writing. I did a Kickstarter for it in March, which gave me [$6k in pre-sales](/my-6k-advance/). As I wrote, I continued to sell discounted early access to the book. In total, XX readers purchased early access to the book, for which I'm grateful. I also have an [old business](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/#zestful) that makes $100-200/month without me touching it.

My main expenses were LLMs, XX, and XX. I don't use AI to write, but I use it for a lot of the accessory tasks like making supporting web apps. And also just fun experiments.

Here's how 2025 compared to previous years:

The years I was running TinyPilot dominate the chart. Still, 2025 was my fourth most profitable year as a founder.

My goal for the year was $50k in profit, so I fell quite short.

The book took more time than I expected. I thought I'd complete the book by about August and have time throughout the year to try several software businesses alongside the book. Instead, I spent all my time on the book, and I'm still not done.

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

When I tell other software developers that I'm writing a book, they usually say something like, "Oh, great!" And then they pause, a little confused, "To give you time for freelance dev work?" And I have to say, "No, I'm _just_ writing a book. That's my whole job."

When I tell friends and family I'm working on a book, they say, "Oh, so you're still on paternity leave?"

No! I'm writing a book. It's a real job!

But if I'm being honest, I understand their confusion. How can you write a book as your job unless you're a novelist or something? It's even harder to convince them it's a real job when I admit that I typically only write for about an hour a day.

So, what am I doing all the other hours?

I typically write about 10 full-length blog posts per year, by writing for about an hour a day. And a book is like 10-12 blog posts, so if I just write a book instead of a blog, I should be done in about a year. Except, it should be even faster because I only spend about an hour a day on my blog, so if I have eight hours to write, I could write a book in a few months.

It turns out that even if I spend all day writing, I can still only write for about an hour a day. After that, I feel too tired and unfocused.

The other thing is that I can't _just_ write my book. I also need to do things to try to find readers for my book, both so I can actually make money from it and so I can get feedback to know whether I'm writing something useful.

Wrote more than I ever have before:

- 150 pages of my book (plus a lot more that I cut)
- 13 blog posts (8 on [my personal blog](/posts/) and 5 on [my book's blog](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/))
- 12 [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/)
- 12 [notes](/notes/) (shorter, less polished blog posts)

## Can I succeed again?

Making $XX on a book is pretty good for a first-time author, but it's obviously not a sustainable income, so one of the questions I've been asking myself a lot this year is: can I create a successful business again?

When I went off on my own, I thought, "What's the worst that could happen? I just go get another software job." With today's software job market, I'm not even sure that safety net exists for me anymore. And even if it does, I'd feel crushed having a boss that expects me to do profitable things rather than blog about [why I hate the passive voice](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/passive-voice-considered-harmful/).

With TinyPilot, I made money, but I also got incredibly lucky in a lot of ways.

There were probably 100 catastrophes that could have occurred to sink the company, and I'm fortunate to live one of the few timelines where none of them occurred. it took me XX years to become reach profitability.

Even the product itself, it wasn't like I recognized that COVID would drive increased demand in remote administration devices and smartly jumped on the opportunity. It was just dumb luck that I happened to be tinkering with something that the market wanted.

I actually have a lot of optimism. It feels like the stars have aligned again to give me an unfair advantage:

- There are an enormous number of useful software products that are now viable to create using AI that would have been too costly to implement before.
- AI is extremely powerful, but it's still at the stage where the only people who can use it to its full potential are senior-level generalist software engineers.
- Other senior software developers who could use AI to build companies either lack motivation or experience in entrepreneurship, whereas I have eight years of experience.

Cloud computing increased the power of a single engineer. To deploy a production-grade web app, you no longer needed a server admin and a software developer: you could just have the . With AI, you can get specialty expertise without hiring an expert. I know I'm not going to have AI. Four years ago, when I wanted to add H.264 video encoding to my app, I had to find an engineer with video encoding experience to implement it. I think I spent $3-5k to show a proof of concept just because nobody on the team was familiar with the APIs. It would have been even more expensive to But today, that's the kind of thing I could just

I did a Kickstarter for the book, and it succeeded by a hair.

## Finding alignment with my business

This has been my favorite year of being a founder since I went off on my own eight years ago.

The major reason is finding alignment between these things:

1. What I enjoy doing
1. What I do well
1. What earns money
1. What serves my users

This is similar to the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which founders have started talking about the last few years.

TODO: Make this a table

For contrast, one of the first businesses I created was a website called Is It Keto. It explained why certain foods did or did not fit the keto diet

- Enjoyment: I didn't care about the keto diet.
- Competence: I wasn't good at finding users or convincing them to buy things.
- Utility to users: I made money if users clicked ads and ordered keto products online, but they would have been better off buying [real food](https://realfood.gov/) at the grocery store.
- Profitability: The site was not profitable.

Writing my book, everything feels a lot more aligned with what I'm interested in and what I'm good at, though I'm still working on the money and utility parts:

- Enjoyment: I'm passionate about clear writing and enjoy teaching techniques to other developers.
- Competence: I feel especially qualified to write about clear writing for software developers I've been blogging for several years, and writing played a key role in all of my businesses.
- Profitability: I've made $XXk from pre-sales which is not profitable enough to be sustainable.
- Utility to users: I hear positive things about the book from readers as they read new chapters, but I want to make sure readers are getting tangible results (e.g., they're getting better feedback or results on their own writing) from the book and not just pseudolearning.

## Do I still love it?

My favorite year. Aligning the things I like. And my wife and I work from home, and our families help out with childcare during the day, so anytime I want, I can take a break to go play with my son.

At the end of [my first year as a founder](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/), I wrote:

> As someone who has always valued independence, I love being a solo developer. It makes a world of difference to wake up whenever I want and make my own choices about how to spend my entire day.
>
> ...
>
> My friends with children tell me that kids won't complicate this at all.

When I wrote that, I was single. I met my wife a few weeks after publishing that, and we had our first child in 2024. It's surprising that it's still true.

Kids and a family mean I can't do whatever I want _all_ day, but I still feel like I do whatever I want from 9-5 every day.

That's still pretty true.

A book is extremely friendly to work-life balance. Nobody's ever paged me at 2 AM to say that says my servers are down, and customers are panicking because they can't read my book.

And even my work setup is super nice. My family comes over to help out with childcare while my wife and I work, so whenever I want a break from work, I get to play with my son, and he's always delighted to see me.

## Lessons learned

### Writing a book takes longer than you expect

This is kind of an extension of [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

> Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#goals-for-next-year) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Earn $50k in profit

- **Result**: Earned $8.2k in profit
- **Grade**: D

TODO

### Publish a course or book

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

### Learn a new programming language

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

## Goals for next year

### Earn five positive citations of my book

I'd like to find successful developer authors who publicly cite my book as a resource that helped them achieve something.

### Earn $75k in profit

### Create a profitable SaaS business
