Eight years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I [post an update](/tags/annual-review/) about how that's going and what my life is like as an indie founder.

Last year, I [sold my first profitable business](/i-sold-tinypilot/) and [became a father](/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#i-became-a-new-parent), so I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make money and balance my work with family time.

## How finances went

People are always most interested in how the money works, so I'll start there. Here's what my revenue and profit looked like every month this year.

<canvas id="monthly-finances-chart"></canvas>

In total, I had $8.2k in profit on $16.3k in revenue. That was my total income for the year, which is obviously not enough to support a family, but my wife also works, and we have savings.

My main source of revenue was my book. I'm writing a book to teach developers to improve their writing. I did a Kickstarter for it in March, which gave me [$6k in pre-sales](/my-6k-advance/). As I wrote, I continued to sell discounted early access to the book. In total, XX readers purchased early access to the book, for which I'm grateful. I also have an [old business](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/#zestful) that makes $100-200/month without me touching it.

My main expenses were LLMs, XX, and XX. I don't use AI to write, but I use it for a lot of the accessory tasks like making supporting web apps. And also just fun experiments.

Here's how 2025 compared to previous years:

<canvas id="annual-finances-chart"></canvas>

The years I was running TinyPilot dominate the chart. Still, 2025 was my fourth most profitable year as a founder.

My goal for the year was $50k in profit, so I fell quite short.

The book took longer to write than I expected. I thought I'd complete the book by August and have time to try several software businesses alongside the book. Instead, I spent all my time on the book, and I'm still not done.

## Why does it take so long to write a book?

When I tell other software developers that I'm writing a book, they usually say something like, "Oh, great!" And then they pause, a little confused, "To give you time for freelance dev work?" And I have to say, "No, I'm _just_ writing a book. That's my whole job."

When I tell friends and family I'm working on a book, they say, "Oh, so you're still on paternity leave?"

No! I'm writing a book. It's a real job!

But if I'm being honest, I understand their confusion. How can writing a book be my job? I'm not a professional author. And why has it taken me more than a year to write a non-fiction book?

When I started the book, I thought I'd be done in six months. I typically write a short book's worth of blog posts per year, and that's just from writing for an hour a day. If I have nothing to do but write a book, I should be done in 1/8th the time!

It turns out that even when all I have to do is write, I can still only write for about an hour per day before I feel drained.

I also can't _just_ write a book. I need to find people to actually read the book, so I also wrote blog posts and published chapter excerpts. I ended up writing far more in the past year than I ever have before:

- 13 blog posts (8 on [my personal blog](/posts/) and 5 on [my book's blog](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/))
- 12 [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/)
- 12 [notes](/notes/) (shorter, less polished blog posts)
- 150 pages of my book, including seven chapters I adapted into [free excerpts](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/)

I spent a lot of time editing blog posts for other developers. That helped me discover other developers' writing pain points and what advice they found effective. I worked with XX clients, and in the process [helped Tyler Cipriani](https://refactoringenglish.com/services/blog-editing/sample-future-of-git/) reach [#1 on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44916783).

And then there's just a bunch of administrative tasks around writing and selling a book like setting up mailing lists, dealing with Stripe, debugging PDF/epub rendering issues, etc. (TODO: links)

## Finding alignment with my business

This has been my favorite year of being a founder since I went off on my own eight years ago. It took me several years to figure out that I feel most fulfilled when I'm doing something that ticks all of these boxes:

1. I enjoy doing it
1. I do it well
1. It earns money
1. It facilitates work-life balance
1. It serves my users

The more popular version of this idea is the Japanese concept of [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), overlaps with most of my categories.

As a concrete example, one of my first businesses back in 2019 was a website called Is It Keto. It was a simple website that explained why certain foods did or did not fit the keto diet.

Here's how Is It Keto scored on my rubric:

| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Enjoyment         | 🔴    | I enjoyed programming but didn't care about the keto diet enough to enjoy writing about it so much.                                                                                                         |
| Competence        | 🔴    | I wasn't good at building websites, finding users, or convincing anyone to buy things.                                                                                                                      |
| Profitability     | 🔴    | The site was [not profitable](/retrospectives/2020/07/#is-it-keto).                                                                                                                                         |
| Work-Life balance | 🟢    | The site was easy to keep online 24/7. Even if there had been an outage, the stakes were so low that I'd only be losing a few dollars of ad revenue per day.                                                |
| Utility to users  | 🟡    | Users found it useful, but I only made money if users clicked ads or ordered keto products online. They probably would have been better off buying [real food](https://realfood.gov/) at the grocery store. |     |

Writing my book, everything feels a lot more aligned with what I'm interested in and what I'm good at, though I'm still working on the money and utility parts:

| Pillar            | Score | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enjoyment         | 🟢    | I'm passionate about clear writing and enjoy teaching techniques to other developers.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Competence        | 🟢    | I feel especially qualified to write about clear writing for software developers I've been blogging for several years, and writing played a key role in all of my businesses.                                                                                  |
| Profitability     | 🟡    | I've made $XXk from pre-sales which feels good for a first-time author, but it's not yet profitable enough to be sustainable.                                                                                                                                  |
| Work-Life balance | 🟢    | Few businesses beat an ebook in terms work-life balance. I can comfortably step away from the book and ignore emails for weeks without it bothering anyone. I've never been paged at 2 AM because my servers are down and users urgently need to read my book. |
| Utility to users  | 🟡    | I hear positive things about the book from readers as they read new chapters, but I want to make sure readers are getting tangible results (e.g., they're getting better feedback or results on their own writing) from the book and not just pseudolearning.  |

## Do I still love it?

At the end of [my first year as a founder](/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/), I wrote:

> As someone who has always valued independence, I love being a solo developer. It makes a world of difference to wake up whenever I want and make my own choices about how to spend my entire day.
>
> ...
>
> My friends with children tell me that kids won't complicate this at all.

I wrote that in 2019, when I was in my early thirties and single.

A few weeks later, I met my wife, and we've been together ever since. We had our first child in 2024. And, surprisingly, my life is still how I described it seven years ago.

Okay, my life isn't _exactly_ what I described in 2019. My toddler decides when I wake up, and it's not always the time his independence-loving father would choose. But I still feel the joy of spending my work days on whatever I choose.

I joked back then about how much kids would complicate my life as an indie founder, but it's actually less complicated than I expected. Plus, it's more fun. My wife and I work from home, and our families come over to do childcare during working hours. Anytime I want, I can take a break from work to go play with my son.

After several years of [just "enjoying" life](/bootstrapped-founder-year-6/#do-i-still-love-it) as a bootstrapped founder, I'm happy to say that I love it again. I still want to do it forever.

## Lessons learned

### Writing a book takes longer than you expect

This is kind of an extension of [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

> Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#goals-for-next-year) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Earn $50k in profit

- **Result**: I earned $8.2k in profit.
- **Grade**: D

TODO

### Publish a course or book

- **Result**: I'm about 80% done with my book.
- **Grade**: C

TODO

### Learn a new programming language

- **Result**: TODO
- **Grade**: TODO

TODO

## Goals for next year

### Earn five book citations

I'd like to find successful developer authors who publicly cite my book as a resource that helped them achieve something.

### Earn $75k in profit

### Create a profitable software business
