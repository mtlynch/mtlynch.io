title: "How I Earned a $6k Advance on My Self-Published Technical Book"
date: 2025-04-18

I'm working on my first technical book, and I just received $XXk in advance sales, even though the book is still only about 25% complete.

I'm self-publishing the book, and I ran a three-week pre-sale on Kickstarter. My biggest fear was spending a year writing a book only to find out afterwards that nobody wants to read it. The pre-sale was a way to confirm that there truly were readers out there interested enough in the topic to pay money.

I haven't seen other authors write books this way, so I thought I'd share more about how and why I did this.

## My unfair advantages

One of my pet peeves is when someone is like, "Wow, I just launched this silly idea, and I've already made $100k in sales. I'm so good at business!" and then you look and realize they have like 5M followers who are excited to give them money for any idea they have.

But, full disclosure, here are the advantages I had going into this:

- I've been blogging for 9 years.
- I have a mailing list of XX subscribers on my personal blog.
- The book has its own mailing list that had XX subscribers when I started the pre-sale.
  - There's overlap between the two. There are at most XX unique subscribers between the two.

## How does this compare to what traditional publishers pay?

Most publishers don't disclose the deals they make with first-time authors, so it's difficult to say how my results compare.

No Starch Press pays up to $8k, but it reduces your royalties to just 10% of sales.

Manning doesn't publish current rates for first-time authors, but Teiva Harsanyi [recently shared](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/100-go-mistakes) that Manning paid him a $4k advance.

The cool thing about self-publishing is that you still have the option to publish a future edition with a traditional publisher. The only person who I've seen talk about this is _Tracy Osborn_, who originally self-published _Hello Web Design_ (great book), and then published [a second edition with No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hello-web-design).

## Where I found customers

## What I'm glad I did

### Used Kickstarter to see if there are readers

I'm glad I chose this. Sets good expectations.

### Picked a target that would make me excited to write the book

I set a crowdfunding goal of $5k. I thought it would be difficult to reach that goal, but I picked a number where, even if I make no further sales, I'd still feel satisfied to earn that money.

I'm still in the honeymoon phase, so hopefully I still feel that way when the book is done.

### Published excerpts during the pre-sale

I published two sample chapters before the pre-sale, and two more during the pre-sale. Looking back, I wish I'd published them all during the pre-sale, but that's only with the benefit of hindsight. It made sense to start publishing book excerpts in a low-pressure way just to see if there was any interest.

### Offering premium rewards

I offered pre-orders of the book for $25 as the standard item in the Kickstarter, but I also offered other options for people who wanted to contribute more:

- $75: Your name and a link on the website, plus a thank you in the first edition of the book.
- $150: Personalized writing feedback on a blog post or draft.
  - I originally priced this at $300 and nobody bought, but four people purchased after I reduced the price to $150.
- $150: Team license to the book for up to 10 people within an organization.

### Avoided offering forever placement in the book

One path I want to keep open is potentially republishing this book later with a tech publisher like No Starch Press. There are a lot of authors who self-published a book and then did a second edition with a publisher, and that seems like the best of both worlds.

So, given that I might do a second edition with a publisher, I didn't want to commit to something like, "Backers will always be mentioned by name in the book," because I don't know if that will complicate things if I eventually go to a publisher and bring them these requirements. I made sure to say that I'd thank backers specifically in the first edition, though I'll try to keep them in forever.

### Self-ads

The pledge meter was maybe helpful. I was just manually updating it.

### Start early

### Looked at other non-fiction book projects

### Didn't overinvest in a slick presentation

You can spend infinite time polishing a presentation and making an amazing video. If you're good at that, that's a good edge, but I just wanted to see if anyone was interested in my book, so I didn't want to spend weeks and weeks making a jaw-dropping Kickstarter page only to find out that nobody was interested in the book to begin with.

## What I wish I'd done differently

### Started with my most excerpt-able chapters

### Enabled late pledges

Apparently they were enabled for my project but not per-item. And then you can't flip them on after without talking to support, but it meant losing momentum.

### Collected better data about what led customers to order

Kickstarter can analyze UTM parameters, but I never added them to any of my links. It probably would have been helpful to know which readers came from my personal blog vs. the book's website vs. the mailing list. They collect data based on the HTTP referer header, but that's not as reliable as UTM parameters.

### Focused on people rather than companies

Again, with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to say I should have skipped soliciting sponsors, but I think the decision made sense at the time.

But even when the one company offered to sponsor for $1k, I didn't feel great about that because it felt like a single company carrying too much of the pre-sale. I expect that the number of pre-orders from regular readers to be predictive of how many customers purchase the finished book, so if I can only sell $3k to regular people, that would have been a bad sign for long-term sales.

### Created more sensible reward tiers

One thing I screwed up in creating the rewards was that I didn't include the book itself in the $75 personal sponsor. So a few people purchased the $75 tier and then were surprised to realize it technically doesn't include the book itself. And once someone has purchased a reward, I can't edit it, even to add items. So, my workaround was just to tell people

## Other notes

### Kickstarter projects attract spam

I got [a ton of spam](/retrospectives/2025/03/#except-for-kickstarter-spammers) from companies trying to "help out" with my presale.

Just be aware of this when you start a Kickstarter. Even though my email isn't in the Kickstarter itself, they found my email address by digging through the book website and then my personal blog.

Fortunately, there's a big surge in spam for the first week of the campaign, and then nothing more after that.
