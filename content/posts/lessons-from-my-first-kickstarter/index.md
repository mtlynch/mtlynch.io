## What I'm glad I did

### Used a pre-sale to see if there are readers

I'm glad I chose this

### Published samples during the pre-sale

I published two sample chapters before the pre-sale, and two more during the pre-sale. Looking back, I wish I'd published them all during the pre-sale, but that's only with the benefit of hindsight. It made sense to start publishing book excerpts in a low-pressure way just to see if there was any interest.

### Offering premium rewards

I offered pre-orders of the book for $25 as the standard item in the Kickstarter, but I also offered other options for people who wanted to contribute more:

- $75: Your name and a link on the website, plus a thank you in the first edition of the book.
- $150: Personalized writing feedback on a blog post or draft.
  - I originally priced this at $300 and nobody bought, but four people purchased after I reduced the price to $150.
- $150: Team license to the book for up to 10 people within an organization.

### Avoided offering forever placement in the book

One path I want to keep open is potentially republishing this book later with a tech publisher like No Starch Press. There are a lot of authors who self-published a book and then did a second edition with a publisher, and that seems like the best of both worlds.

So, given that I might do a second edition with a publisher, I didn't want to commit to something like, "Backers will always be mentioned by name in the book," because I don't know if that will complicate things if I eventually go to a publisher and bring them these requirements. I made sure to say that I'd thank backers specifically in the first edition, though I'll try to keep them in forever.

### Self-ads

The pledge meter was maybe helpful. I was just manually updating it.

### Start early

### Look at other non-fiction book projects

### Don't overinvest in a slick presentation

You can spend infinite time polishing a presentation and making an amazing video. If you're good at that, that's a good edge, but I just wanted to see if anyone was interested in my book, so I didn't want to spend weeks and weeks making a jaw-dropping Kickstarter page only to find out that nobody was interested in the book to begin with.

## What I wish I'd done differently

### Collected better data about what led customers to order

Kickstarter can analyze UTM parameters, but I never added them to any of my links. It probably would have been helpful to know which readers came from my personal blog vs. the book's website vs. the mailing list. They collect data based on the HTTP referer header, but that's not as reliable as UTM parameters.

### Focused on individuals rather than sponsors

Again, with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to say I should have skipped soliciting sponsors, but I think the decision made sense at the time.

But even when the one company offered to sponsor for $1k, I didn't feel great about that because it felt like a single company carrying too much of the pre-sale. I expect that the number of pre-orders from regular readers to be predictive of how many customers purchase the finished book, so if I can only sell $3k to regular people, that would have been a bad sign for long-term sales.

### Created more sensible reward tiers

One thing I screwed up in creating the rewards was that I didn't include the book itself in the $75 personal sponsor. So a few people purchased the $75 tier and then were surprised to realize it technically doesn't include the book itself. And once someone has purchased a reward, I can't edit it, even to add items. So, my workaround was just to tell people

## Other notes

### Kickstarter projects attract spam

I got [a ton of spam](/retrospectives/2025/03/#except-for-kickstarter-spammers) from companies trying to "help out" with my presale.

Just be aware of this when you start a Kickstarter. Even though my email isn't in the Kickstarter itself, they found my email address by digging through the book website and then my personal blog.

Fortunately, there's a big surge in spam for the first week of the campaign, and then nothing more after that.

### Kickstarter reward tiers are confusing

Description and delivery date are properties of the tier, which doesn't make sense
