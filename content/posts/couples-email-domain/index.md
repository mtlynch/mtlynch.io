I've only been married for a few years, but I have a hot marriage tip that no book or couple's therapist will ever tell you: get a couple's email domain.

## What's a couple's email domain?

My wife and I share an email domain. I'm not going to reveal the real one, but pretend it's this:

- @shinytable.com

Emails to michael@shinytable.com go to both me and my wife, and same for her name.

## No, not a shared Gmail account

When I tell people that my wife and I have a couple's email domain, they think I mean that I registered a Gmail account like michaelandhiswife@gmail.com, and we both check that account in addition to our regular email accounts. That's not what I mean.

We have a couple's email _domain_. We still send and receive email through our normal email accounts.

If you email michael@shinytable.com or my wife's name, we both receive the email in our normal inboxes. We don't have a special @shinytable.com inbox we have to check separately. Similarly, we can both send emails as each other, if needed.

You can get most of the same benefits by sharing an extra email account, but then you're stuck checking an extra inbox. With a shared inbox, the read/unread status ceases to be effective because it doesn't track who read the email.

## Why get a couple's email domain?

### Keeping everyone looped in with vendors

I got the idea for a couple's email domain while my wife and I were planning our wedding. Despite the fact that it's a core part of their job, most wedding vendors don't seem to understand how to send emails to two people at once.

If I emailed a photographer and cc'ed my wife, half the time the photographer would reply only to me, cutting my wife out of the conversation.

By switching to a couple's email domain, we made it impossible for vendors to accidentally drop one of us from the thread. Even when emails were addressed only to michael@shinytable.com, they still went to my wife as well.

### Shared online accounts

As a married couple, my wife and I have a lot of shared online accounts: insurance, tax bills, grocery delivery, etc.

We sign up for all shared services using our couple's email domain and save the credentials in our shared password manager, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). That way, we both receive all notices related to our shared accounts. If we ever have to do a password reset, either of us can do it.

## Picking a good domain name

My wife and I chose our couple's email domain based on an inside joke. It was fun at first, but we realized it was too hard to spell out over the phone, so we got a new one.

When picking a couple's domain name, consider the experience of saying your email address on phone calls, especially to support reps who may not have strong English skills:

- Choose words that have easy, unambiguous spelling
  - e.g., don't use a word like "scent" because people might think you meant "sent" or "cent."
  - e.g., don't use a word like "accommodate" because only six people can spell it correctly on their first try.
- Choose words that sound distinct from other words, especially in sequence
  - e.g., if you choose "clean ditch," people will probably mishear it as "clean dish."

So, shinytable.com is not our real domain, but it would be a good one because most English speakers can spell the words "shiny" and "table," and it's hard to mishear "shiny table dot com" as something else.

## How to set up a couple's email domain

You have to buy a domain.

I have a Fastmail account because they let you do a lot with custom domains.

You can send and receive email from a custom domain using [a basic, free Gmail account](https://andykong.org/blog/freebusinessemail/), but they make it a somewhat tedious process.

## Avoid double replies: cc your spouse

On group threads with you and your spouse, you do still have to watch out for the other party dropping one of you from the thread. If that happens, you'd both still receive replies from the other party, but you'd miss your spouse's reply.

To prevent this, just make sure to cc or bcc your spouse (or yourself) on all replies.

In practice, this has rarely been a problem. If we're both on an email thread with a vendor, typically one of us is actively managing the project and the other is just following along. Even if we forget to cc each other, we're still seeing all the responses from the vendor.

## Don't give your couple's email address to friends and family

When I first set up our couple's email domain, I was so excited about how well it worked that I thought about using it for all emails threads we're both on, including with family and friends.

Then, I realized that if a person emails michael@shinytable.com, they'd reasonably assume I'm the only recipient and might say something they don't mean for my wife to see.

**Note** If you're reading this, and you're my wife, I just mean for like... surprise parties and stuff.

## Bonus: Per-service couple's email addresses

These days, if I order a $7 spatula online, the merchant immediately starts spamming me about kitchenware deals and shares my email with their 900 closest, trusted advertising partners.

To prevent spam, I go a step further with my couple's email domain and give each vendor a unique email address. So, instead of entering michael@shinytable.com as my email address at checkout, I'd use the vendor's name, like cheapspatulasdirect@shinytable.com. If I start receiving spam, I just block emails from cheapspatulasdirect@shinytable.com.

Per-service email addresses are fine when I'm just typing the address into a web form, but if I tell Jane the dogwalker that my email address is jane.the.dogwalker@shinytable.com, she gets confused or weirded out. In those cases, I'll say Michael but add a semi-random suffix like michael.dw5@shinytable.com, where "dw" is for dogwalker and the 5 is in case I've used "dw" as a suffix before.

I use the same technique to obscure the vendor's name for services that are aggressive at fraud prevention. I once signed up for a food delivery service, and as soon as I placed my first order, they flagged my account as fraudulent and canceled my order. I strongly suspect that it was because I used their name as my email address. So, now, if I sign up with a service that might be sensitive to fraud, I do my name plus some random numbers.

Per-service email domains work especially well with Fastmail, as they allow unlimited email addresses and support wildcard ("catch-all") addresses (`*@shinytable.com`). You can theoretically do this with Gmail as well
