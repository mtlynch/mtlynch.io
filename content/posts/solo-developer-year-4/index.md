Four years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to experiment with bootstrapping a software business.

For the first few years, I experimented with several different businesses, but none of them worked out. Finally, in 2020, I created a business called TinyPilot, which caught on and continued growing throughout 2021, finishing the year with $XXk in annual revenue.

In this post, I'll share what I've learned from running TinyPilot about what I've learned about being a bootstrapped founder.

**How can you afford to keep losing money?**

I went into more detail [in my year two retrospective](/solo-developer-year-2/#how-can-you-afford-to-keep-losing-money), but the short answer is: low cost of living, significant savings from my Google days, and passive investment income.

## TinyPilot's second year

TinyPilot is an open-source KVM over IP device built on the Raspberry Pi. It allows you to control another computer from your browser without installing any software, even when the computer has no network connectivity or hasn't booted into an OS.

At the start of 2021, I was TinyPilot's sole developer, customer support person, salesperson, and marketer. The only other employee was my girlfriend, who managed inventory and fulfilled orders. We ran TinyPilot out of our home, which was slowly transforming into a TinyPilot warehouse.

Today, TinyPilot has a real office, a two-person fulfillment staff, a team of three developers, and a [distributor in Europe](https://kvm-ip.de).

Revenue is XXx what from 2020, but we also had the full year. But sales are growing steadily.

### Software progress

The software has changed a lot in the last year, too. For fun, I installed the version of TinyPilot from January 2021 and compared it to our January 2022 release. I was surprised at how much has changed in just a year in just the UI:

TODO: GIF comparison

We've added several major features in the last year including:

* Mounting virtual USB drives and CD-ROMs
* Wake on LAN
* Password-based authentication
* Software updates from the web UI
* Video bandwidth tuning

## Other projects

### *Refactoring English*

One of my 2021 goals (TODO: link) was to publish a book about techniques developers can use to improve their writing. I've learned several techniques and habits that have made my writing more effective. I wanted to write a book capturing all the techniques I apply when writing.

My great shame of the year is that I made almost no progress on this book.

I've had a morning ritual for the past three years of writing for an hour every morning. That generally translated to about ten blog posts per year. I thought that if I spent that time on a book instead, I'd be done within a year.

Unfortunately, TinyPilot has its own pace that I don't fully control. For the first few months of 2021, I stuck to writing for an hour in the morning, but I'd end every day without finishing everything I needed to do for TinyPilot. I decided to [suspend my writing](/retrospectives/2021/09/#can-i-afford-to-keep-writing) until TinyPilot required less attention, but that never happened.

I'm still excited to write this book, and I hope I have more time for it this year.

### mtlynch.io (this blog)

As with my lack of book-writing time, I had very little blog-writing time. I published three new blog posts, my fewest-ever in five years of blogging.

Ironically, the year that I have the least amount of time to write is the year that I had the most to write about. There are so many things I have to learn for TinyPilot that I wish I could capture while the experience is still fresh in my mind, but there just isn't enough time.

I kept my habit of writing [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/). I can budget time for those because an unambiguous net positive for my business, even in the short term. Almost every retrospective I write, I discover some flaw in my strategy or a weakness in my plans that I wouldn't have noticed had I not sat down to organize my thoughts and write everything out.

### Hit the Front Page of Hacker News

{{<img src="htfp-cover.png" maxWidth="550px" caption="[*Hit the Front Page of Hacker News*](https://hitthefrontpage.com) is my course about my blogging for technically sophisticated readers.">}}

At the beginning of the year, I released my first-ever paid course. It explained my approach to writing blog posts that gain traction on tech-oriented sites like Hacker News and reddit.

I'm proud of the content, and I've heard positive feedback from customers. A few people credited it with helping them write blog posts that became very popular on Hacker News.

It earned $XX in its first year, which was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for something closer to $20k. Had TinyPilot not been so busy, I could have spent more time marketing it and gotten closer to my goal. Still, the expereience taught me a lot about creating an educational product, and I'd like to do more of it in the future.

### Is It Keto

{{<img src="isitketo-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" caption="[Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) tells readers which foods fit the keto diet.">}}

I started [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) in 2018. It's a simple site that tells you whether or not particular foods fit the keto diet. It earns money from Amazon Affiliate links and Google AdSense.

I put the site on the backburner when I started TinyPilot, but it continued to grow on its own in 2021, providing a nice side income of $500-$1k per month.

Around June, I noticed another site overtake Is It Keto for most search queries. They have the same idea as my site, but they've scaled the content better, and they're continuing to improve the site, so they're rightfully absorbing all of my visitors and revenue.

I considered selling the site but I suspect it's only worth $5-10k. It would probably take 30-60 hours to go through the sales process, and I'd rather spend that time on TinyPilot.

### Zestful

{{<img src="zestful-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Zestful website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" caption="[Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) is an API that parses recipe ingredients into structured data.">}}

Zestful is a paid service that parses recipe ingredients into structured data. For example, if you give it the string `"2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"`, it tells you that the quantity is `2.5`, the product is `parsley`, the preparation is `finely chopped`, etc.

I created Zestful in 2019 and worked on it for a few months before writing it off as a failure. It attracted clients every few months for one-time bulk parses, but it never generated revenue consistently.

2021 was a nice comeback year for Zestful. It had occasionally attracted clients for one-time bulk jobs, but it never generated revenue reliably. Starting midyear, I began seeing revenue more regularly. New clients started building on top of Zestful, and old clients were increasing their usage. It now earns a few hundred dollars per month, and in December it broke $1k for the first time from pay-as-you-go users.

Because of TinyPilot, I don't have time to work on the site, but it fortunately hasn't required any work at all. None of the clients have reported issues or requested technical support, so it's living the SaaS dream of pure passive income.

## Lessons learned

### Sell just one thing

For most of the year, TinyPilot earned a steady $20-30k per month in revenue. The months where there was a bump in revenue, it was because we got a new positive review from a popular YouTube channel.

Starting in October, revenues doubled to $40-60k per month. TinyPilot didn't receive any new reviews in that span. In fact, I didn't do any marketing at all.

So, what doubled our sales? I got rid of our product page.

Until that point, TinyPilot had always offered different versions so that customers could a product to match their budget. Customers who wanted the custom-designed plug 'n play model could buy our flagship TinyPilot Voyager. Customers who wanted a more DIY experience could buy our Hobbyist Kit. People who already had all the hardware could buy a software-only package.

{{<img src="old-product-page.png" alt="Screenshot of old TinyPilot product page, listing Voyager and Hobbyist kit side-by-side" maxWidth="600px" caption="TinyPilot used to offer a variety of products." hasBorder="true">}}

In October, I got rid of the product catalog and instead focused the website exclusively on my main product, the TinyPilot Voyager.

TODO: Screenshot of product page

Sales jumped immediately. At first, I thought it might be a coincidence, but they've stayed in their new range for several months now.

I considered taking it a step further and selling zero products. That would logically increase my revenue to infinity, but I don't want to be greedy.

{{<img src="weekly-revenue.png" alt="Graph of TinyPilot weekly revenue, where an increase in revenue immediately follows consolidation to one product" maxWidth="700px" caption="TinyPilot’s weekly sales before and after simplifying the website to sell a single product">}}

### Thoughtful management attracts a strong team

A few months ago, I had a video call with my friend Matt. Matt and I met fresh out of college as developers on the BitLocker team at Microsoft.  He's one of the smartest developers I know, and he has incredible insight into software and organizations at both a high level and a low level.

He had followed TinyPilot's progress on my blog, but this was the first time Matt and I were talking about it. I mentioned how lucky I was that I ended up with such a good team. The developers I hired and the local staff that run the TinyPilot office have all worked out great.

>Well, give yourself some credit. I know you, and you probably shaped that team by putting processes in place that allowed people to work well.

In my experience, Matt is right about everything, so I have no choice but to accept his praise.

I'm certainly not an expert manager, but I think Matt is right that some of my. Based on my frustrations with previous jobs, I tried to create processes that avoided the things that frustrated me at previous jobs. I w

* Employees have flexibility.
* I give [thorough details](/freelancer-guidelines/) about what to expect from the hiring process and the job.
* My hiring process is quick, as talented people don't want to waste time on a lengthy, unpaid screening process.
* Communication is mostly written and asynchronous, which gives people flexibility.
* I document processes and encourage others to invest in documentation so that everyone has clear, shared expectations.
* We operate under the assumption that everyone who works on TinyPilot is smart and well-intentioned, so when things go wrong, it indicates a bad process rather than a bad person.

### Good leadership means helping teammates grow

{{<img src="jason-cohen-usual-saaspects.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Jason Cohen being interviewed on The Usual Saaspects podcast" maxWidth="800px" caption="Jason Cohen (left) speaking to Ch Daniel (right) on [*The Usual Saaspects* podcast](https://youtu.be/Sjs5gEUlZyU?t=3605)">}}

WPEngine founder Jason Cohen [did an interview interview](https://youtu.be/Sjs5gEUlZyU?t=3605) recently, and his thoughts about leadership stuck with me:

>With leadership, yes, you're trying to get the right answers, and goals, and decisions... You're also trying to build a team that's smarter and better, that's themselves making better decisions, themselves are coming up with better answers, themselves have better context...
>
>If you're the only one who can do that in the room, you're a terrible leader. Because that means your team isn't getting better.
>
>**The only way for the organization to succeed is if the team is getting better. And that's your job: to build great teams.**

When I started TinyPilot, I felt like a manager's job was to ensure that employees can focus on the job they were hired to do. If you're hired to write . It's true, but it doesn't leave room for growth. If I'm still doing work as a manager to package work to be ready for them, can I give them more autonomy by giving that up?

This change in strategy drastically improved TinyPilot's approach to customer service. For most of the year, I felt like customer service *had* to be my job. My dev team didn't have the bandwidth, and my fulfillment staff didn't have the training to troubleshoot technical issues.

But a few months ago, one member of TinyPilot's fulfillment staff said he was interested in more hours, so we decided to try sharing responsibility for customer support. Eric could handle the non-technical issues like tracking down stuck packages or handling special requests from customers. If he ran into an issue, he could search our documentation and help forums and answer based on that, and otherwise, and if that didn't work, he could escalate to me.

Now, Eric handles about 80% of customer service emails on his own.

Remember my big insight that TinyPilot should offer only a single product? That happened the same month that Eric started sharing customer support with me, and it's no coincidence. Letting go of that task gave me space to re-evaluate the website and experiment with changes.

## Grading last year's goals

At the start of last year, I [set three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-3/#goals-for-year-four).

### Grow TinyPilot to $600k in annual revenue

* **Result**: Grew TinyPilot's revenue $XXk to $XXk
* **Grade**: B

$600k turned out to be a bit overly optimistic. At the time I was setting my 2021 goals, revenue had grown 20-200% for the previous five months. The month after, sales slumped and I never recaptured the rapid growth of the first few months.

Still, $XXk is nothing to sneeze at. It's possible that different decsions would have brought me to $600k, but nothing stands out as a blunder based on what I knew at the time.

### Publish six blog posts and one book

* **Result**: Published three blog posts and zero books
* **Grade**: D

Writing is one of the things I most enjoy, so I'm disappointed I had so little time for it. Looking back, I still wouldn't have changed how I allocated my time.

### Automate TinyPilot management

* **Result**: Systematized enough of TinyPilot to take a one-week vacation
* **Grade**: B-

I've made a lot of progress in getting myself out of the critical path. I took a one-week vacation over the holidays. It went smoothly, though I did have to do about 30 minutes of emergency work to prevent thousands of dollars of equipment from being sent back to China.

## Goals for year four

### Grow TinyPilot to $1M in annual revenue

There hasn't been any time for marketing. I think I should be able to explore more marketing channels. I've reached out to YouTube reviewers offering them review units, and that's been successful, but there are tons of paid marketing channels I haven't tested at all. I think there's a lot of room to grow.

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

I've been disciplined about not working on TinyPilot during evenings or weekends, but I crave more slack time. The times when I most enjoy TinyPilot the least are when I have a thousand short-term things to do, and it's more work to delegate them than to do them myself. The times I enjoy TinyPilot the most are when everything's running smoothly so that I cna think about ways to grow the business or improve the product.

This year, I'd like to continue systematizing TinyPilot so that everything runs smoothly if I only work 20 hours per week. That would free up time for me to write more or work on software for the fun of it, which I don't get to do now.

## Do I still love it?

When I do these writeups, I think about whether I'm happy with life as a bootstrapped founder.

This year was definitely my most stressful.

The part I like is that I finally feel like I'm running a real business. In my previous projects, revenue would be less than $200/month. At that scale, most options for growth are prohibitively expensive. that scale, there's not really any interesting business decisions to make. Like, do I hire a competent developer to write four lines of code with that $50?

And it's not so much being an indie business as much as the type of business I've chosen. For TinyPilot, I'm a software business, a hardware business, and an e-commerce business all at once. But that has a benefit too of creating a good moat. Other developers might see

I love writing and programming, and the past year didn't leave me much time to do either. The nature of the business requires . My team is growing

But am I still happy that I quit my job at Google? Definitely.
