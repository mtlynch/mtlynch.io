## The high-level view

## TinyPilot

I started TinyPilot two and a half years into becoming a bootstrapped founder. It's software that runs on a Raspberry Pi that allows you to control a computer remotely, even in BIOS.

* Built a team of three freelance developers
* Created a local fulfillment office and hired two employees
* Released a new product
* Partnered with a distributor in the EU

I used to title these updates "My X Year as a Solo Founder," but I'm no longer a solo founder. I work so frequently with a team of developers, fulfillment staff, distributors, 3D printing vendors, and electrical engineers that "solo" doesn't make sense anymore.

The app itself saw several improvements:

* TLS support
* Mount virtual drives
* Easy version-to-version updates
* Wake on LAN
* Overhauled the UI

### Is It Keto

#### Why don't you sell the site?

I'd guess that market price for the site is $8-15k, but it would take me 30-60 hours to manage the acquisition. I expect a better return on investment working on TinyPilot, so I'm better off just collecting the revenue even if the site slowly dies.

### Zestful

2021 was a nice comeback year for Zestful. The only work I did on it was to publish a Python SDK for it. I don't think that had anything to do with the growth.

### LogPaste

I created LogPaste because I wanted an easy way for TinyPilot users to share their diagnostic logs with me. Every other solution I found was too heavyweight, so

```bash
$ echo "hello, world!" | curl -F '_=<-' https://logpaste.com
http://logpaste.com/BQGczWYC
```

## Lessons learned

### Sell just one thing

### Plan to fail for four years

### Good management attracts good employees

I think that's also good management...

### Organizations succeed when the team improves

I quoted Jason Cohen last year, and I'll quote him again from a more recent interview.

Handling rush orders.

Letting developers peer review.

## Favorite discoveries

* beancount
* Litestream
* TalkYard

## Grading last year's goals

At the start of last year, I [set three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-3/#goals-for-year-four).

### Grow TinyPilot to $600k in annual revenue

* **Result**:
* **Grade**:

### Publish six blog posts and one book

* **Result**: Published two blog posts and zero books
* **Grade**: D

I got

I have more topics I want to write about than ever before but no time to write.

### Automate TinyPilot management

* **Result**:
* **Grade**: C

This time last year, I was still running TinyPilot out of my house, and my girlfriend and I were the only employees.

I've made a lot of progress in getting myself out of the critical path. I took a one-week vacation over the holidays, and that mostly worked fine, although I did have to do about 30 minutes of emergency work to prevent thousands of dollars of equipment from being sent back to China.

## Goals for year four

### Grow TinyPilot to $1M in annual revenue

There hasn't been any time for marketing. I think I should be able to explore more marketing channels. I've reached out to YouTube reviewers offering them review units, and that's been successful, but there are tons of paid marketing channels I haven't tested at all. I think there's a lot of room to grow.

 double revenue

### Reduce TinyPilot to 30 hours per week

This is a continuation of my goal from last time. I'd like to manage TinyPilot on 30 hours per week so that I have time left over to write and develop new skills.

I feel like I get stuck in what XX calls the urgent but unimportant quadrant. The time I enjoy TinyPilot the most are when I feel like I've gotten through all of my emails and I have time to think about new things to add. The times when I enjoy it least are when it feels like there are a thousand little things that need to get done, and I'm the only one in a position to do them.

## Do I still love it?

This has definitely been my most stressful year as a bootstrapped founder.

I love writing and programming, and the past year didn't leave me much time to do either. The nature of the business requires . My team is growing

I still prefer it to working for any employer I've had, but it's not a happy-go-lucky. I'd like to find ways back to the parts that I loved.
