Four years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own self-funded software business.

For the first few years, all of my businesses flopped. Nothing I made generated more than a few hundred dollars per month in revenue.

Halfway through my third year, I created a business called [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), which caught on. That's been my main focus ever since. 2021 was TinyPilot's first full year in operation, and it generated $460k in revenue.

In this post, I'll share what I've learned about being a bootstrapped founder from running TinyPilot and my other businesses this past year.

## My first year of profit

After running in the red for the first few years, this is my first year of profit. I earned $13k in profit for the year. Although TinyPilot generated the vast majority of revenue, most of my profit came from old projects that have been running in the background.

**How can you afford to live on so little money?**

I went into more detail [in my year two retrospective](/solo-developer-year-2/#how-can-you-afford-to-keep-losing-money), but the short answer is: low cost of living, significant savings from my Google days, and passive investment income.

## TinyPilot's second year

{{<img src="tinypilot-screenshot.png" maxWidth="650px" caption="[TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com) is an open-source KVM over IP device built on the Raspberry Pi" hasBorder="true">}}

In 2021, I focused on running [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), the business I created in 2020. TinyPilot is an open-source KVM over IP device built on the Raspberry Pi. It allows you to control another computer from your browser without installing any software, even if the computer has no OS installed and no network connectivity.

At the start of 2021, I was TinyPilot's sole developer, customer support agent, salesperson, and marketer. The only other employee was my girlfriend, who managed inventory and fulfilled orders. We ran TinyPilot out of our home, which was slowly transforming into a TinyPilot warehouse.

Today, TinyPilot has a real office, a two-person fulfillment staff, a team of three developers, and a [distributor in Europe](https://kvm-ip.de).

### TinyPilot finances

Revenue grew by eightfold from 2020, and they're continuing to grow.

**Note**: I also have $59k in inventory, but I don't know a useful way to factor that into net profit.

### TinyPilot's software development

The software has changed a lot in the last year, too. We've added several major features, including:

* Mount virtual USB drives and CD-ROMs
* Wake on LAN
* Password-based authentication
* Software updates from the web UI
* Video bandwidth tuning

For fun, I installed the version of TinyPilot from January 2021 and compared it to our January 2022 release. I was surprised at how much has changed in the last year:

</div>

## Other projects

### *Refactoring English*

One of my [2021 goals](/solo-developer-year-3/#publish-six-blog-posts-and-one-book) was to publish a book about techniques developers can use to improve their writing. In writing this blog for the past five years, I've learned several techniques that have made my writing clearer, more interesting, and more accessible. I wanted to write a book capturing everything I've learned.

My great shame of the year is that I made almost no progress on the book.

I've had a ritual for the past three years of writing for an hour every morning. That generally translated to about ten blog posts per year. I thought that if I spent that time on a book instead, I'd be done within the year.

Unfortunately, TinyPilot has its own pace that I don't fully control. For the first few months of 2021, I stuck to writing for an hour in the morning, but I'd end every day seriously behind on TinyPilot. I decided to suspend my writing until TinyPilot required less management, but that never happened.

I'm still excited to write the book, and I hope I have more time for it this year.

### mtlynch.io (this blog)

As with my lack of book-writing time, I had very little blog-writing time. I published three new blog posts, my fewest-ever in five years of blogging.

Ironically, the year that I have the least amount of time to write is the year that I was most desperate to do it. There are so many things I have to learn for TinyPilot that I wish I could capture while the experience is still fresh in my mind, but there just isn't enough time.

I kept my habit of writing [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives/). I can budget time for those because they're unambiguously a net positive for my business, even in the short term. Almost every retrospective I write, I discover some flaw in my strategy or a weakness in my plans that I wouldn't have noticed had I not sat down to organize my thoughts.

### Hit the Front Page of Hacker News

{{<img src="htfp-cover.png" maxWidth="550px" caption="[*Hit the Front Page of Hacker News*](https://hitthefrontpage.com) is my course about my blogging for technically sophisticated readers.">}}

At the beginning of the year, I released my first-ever paid course. It explained my approach to writing blog posts that gain traction on tech-oriented sites like Hacker News and reddit.

I'm proud of the content, and I've heard positive feedback from customers. A few people credited the course with helping them write blog posts that reached the #1 spot on Hacker News.

It earned $7.3k in its first year, which was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for something closer to $20k. Had TinyPilot not been so busy, I could have spent more time marketing the course and gotten closer to my goal. Still, the expereience taught me a lot about creating an educational product, and I'd like to do more of it in the future.

### Is It Keto

{{<img src="isitketo-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" caption="[Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) tells readers which foods fit the keto diet.">}}

I started [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) in 2018. It's a simple site that tells you whether or not particular foods fit the keto diet. It earns money from Amazon Affiliate links and Google AdSense.

I put the site on the backburner when I started TinyPilot, but it continued to grow on its own in 2021, providing a nice side income of $500-$1k/month. That slowed down around June, as other sites began offering similar content and supplanted Is It Keto in search results.

I considered selling the site but I suspect it's only worth $5-10k. It would probably take 30-60 hours to go through the sales process, and I'd rather spend that time on TinyPilot.

### Zestful

{{<img src="zestful-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Zestful website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" caption="[Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) is an API that parses recipe ingredients into structured data.">}}

Zestful is a paid service that parses recipe ingredients into structured data. For example, if you give it the string `"2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"`, it tells you that the quantity is `2.5`, the product is `parsley`, the preparation step is `finely chopped`, etc.

I created Zestful in 2019 and worked on it for a few months before writing it off as a failure. It attracted clients every few months for one-time bulk parses, but it never generated revenue consistently.

2021 was a nice comeback year for Zestful. Starting midyear, I began seeing revenue more regularly. New clients started building on top of Zestful, and old clients were increasing their usage. It now earns a few hundred dollars per month, and in December it broke $1k for the first time from pay-as-you-go users.

Because of TinyPilot, I don't have time to work on Zestful, but it fortunately hasn't required any work at all. None of Zestful's customers have reported issues or requested technical support, so it's living the SaaS dream of pure passive income.

## Lessons learned

### Sell just one thing

For most of the year, TinyPilot earned a steady $20-30k/month in revenue. The months where there was a sales bump, it was because we got positive reviews from YouTube channels.

Starting in October, revenues doubled to $40-60k/month. TinyPilot didn't receive any new reviews in that period. In fact, I didn't do any marketing at all in those months.

So, what doubled our sales? I got rid of our product page.

Until that point, TinyPilot had always offered different versions so that customers could pick the TinyPilot product that matched their budget. Customers who wanted the custom-designed plug 'n play model could buy our flagship TinyPilot Voyager. Customers who wanted a more DIY experience could buy our Hobbyist Kit. People who already had all the hardware could buy a software-only package.

{{<img src="old-product-page.png" alt="Screenshot of old TinyPilot product page, listing Voyager and Hobbyist kit side-by-side" maxWidth="600px" caption="TinyPilot used to offer a variety of products." hasBorder="true">}}

In October, I got rid of the product catalog and instead focused the website exclusively on my main product, the TinyPilot Voyager.

{{<img src="no-catalog.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot website with product catalog removed" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" caption="In October, I removed the product catalog page from TinyPilot and focused on my flagship product.">}}

Sales jumped immediately. At first, I thought it might be a coincidence, but they've stayed in their new range for several months now.

{{<img src="weekly-revenue.png" alt="Graph of TinyPilot weekly revenue, where an increase in revenue immediately follows consolidation to one product" maxWidth="700px" caption="TinyPilot’s weekly sales before and after simplifying the website to sell a single product">}}

{{<notice type="info">}}
**Note**: I considered taking my strategy a step further and selling zero products. That would logically increase my revenue to infinity, but I didn't want to be greedy.
{{</notice>}}

### Good leadership means helping teammates grow

{{<img src="jason-cohen-usual-saaspects.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Jason Cohen being interviewed on The Usual Saaspects podcast" maxWidth="800px" caption="Jason Cohen (left) speaking to Ch Daniel (right) on [*The Usual Saaspects* podcast](https://youtu.be/Sjs5gEUlZyU?t=3605)">}}

In a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/Sjs5gEUlZyU?t=3605), WPEngine founder Jason Cohen described leadership in a way that stuck with me:

>With leadership, yes, you're trying to get the right answers, and goals, and decisions... You're also trying to build a team that's smarter and better, that's themselves making better decisions, themselves are coming up with better answers, themselves have better context...
>
>If you're the only one who can do that in the room, you're a terrible leader. Because that means your team isn't getting better.
>
>**The only way for the organization to succeed is if the team is getting better. And that's your job: to build great teams.**

When I started TinyPilot, I thought that good management meant protecting my employees from anything outside their job description. If I prepared work for them, they could focus happily on their narrow role.

Over time, I realized that my protectiveness limited growth. People enjoy learning and evolving in their careers. If I'm limiting employees from doing anything but their original job, then I'm hindering their development.

I saw this effect most starkly in my approach to customer service. In October, Eric, a member of TinyPilot's fulfillment staff, said he was interested in increasing his hours. We decided that he'd share customer support with me. It was something I'd considered before, but I worried that too many support requests required technical knowledge that only I had.

As soon as Eric began working on the support queue, I realized we should have done it earlier. I overestimated the difficulty of our customers' technical questions. Eric could solve most customer issues by referring to our help forum and email archives. When he couldn't, he'd just escalate to me. Now, Eric handles about 70% of customer support emails without me.

Eric was surprised at how much he enjoyed taking over customer service. Talking to our customers has made him feel more invested in the business and gives him more insight into how his work benefits them.

And remember my big insight about [consolidating TinyPilot to a single product](/solo-developer-year-4/#sell-just-one-thing)? That happened the same month that Eric started sharing customer support with me. It's no coincidence. Ceding that task freed me from several hours of work per week, giving me the space to think critically about the way customers see TinyPilot.

## Grading last year's goals

At the start of last year, I [set three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-3/#goals-for-year-four).

### Grow TinyPilot to $600k in annual revenue

* **Result**: Quadrupled TinyPilot's monthly revenue, totalling $468k for the year
* **Grade**: B

Okay, my $600k revenue goal turned out to be tad a bit optimistic. I chose that number in January 2021, when revenue had grown 20-200% for the previous five months. After I announced that goal, TinyPilot's shrunk over the next two months by 50%. I never recaptured the consistent growth of those first few months.

Still, $468k is nothing to sneeze at. It's possible that different decsions would have brought me to $600k, but nothing stands out as an egregious blunder.

### Publish six blog posts and one book

* **Result**: Published three blog posts and zero books
* **Grade**: D

Writing is one of the things I enjoy most, so I'm disappointed I had so little time for it.

Looking back, I still feel like it was the right decision to deprioritize my writing so that I had more time to smooth out TinyPilot.

### Automate TinyPilot management

* **Result**: Systematized enough of TinyPilot to take a one-week vacation
* **Grade**: B-

I've made a lot of progress in getting myself out of the critical path in TinyPilot's day-to-day operations.

My goal was to be able to take a two-week vaction, and I'm not quite there yet. I took a one-week vacation over the holidays where I didn't check work email. That went pretty well, though I did have to take a call from FedEx to prevent thousands of dollars of equipment from being sent back to China.

## Goals for year four

### Grow TinyPilot to $1M in annual revenue

I've never invested as much as I want in marketing for TinyPilot. I've been fortunate that TinyPilot can survive almost exclusively on word of mouth and organic search.

The only marketing I've done is sending free units to YouTube creators to review. That worked pretty well, but there are tons of marketing channels that I've never explored at all.

I think the right marketing channels could double my current revenue. And if I double to $900k, why not just make it a cool million?

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

The times when I enjoy TinyPilot most are when things are running smoothly enough to give me space to think about ways to grow the business or improve the product. The least pleasant times are when I have a thousand short-term things to do, and they're urgent enough that I can't delegate them to my teammates.

This year, I'd like to continue systematizing TinyPilot so that everything runs smoothly if I only work 20 hours per week. That would also free up time for me to write and code, neither of which I have time for now.

### Ship a new TinyPilot hardware product

TinyPilot's core hardware is a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. The Pi has been fantastic in getting TinyPilot up and running, but we're starting to feel its limitations as we grow.

I plan to work with my electrical engineering vendor to develop a new TinyPilot product that replaces the Raspberry Pi with a custom board that we can optimize for our customers' needs.

## Do I still love it?

When I do these writeups, I think about whether I still love being a bootstrapped founder. This is the first year where it's difficult to say yes. I still like my job, but it's not as fun and easy as when I was just building unsuccessful software products and blogging about it.

I enjoy feeling like I run a real business. Before TinyPilot, my businesses typically earned less than $500/month. At that scale, I felt extremely limited. It's not enough to hire for any skilled roles or pay for expert guidance. I frequently had to solve uninteresting problems simply because my revenue was too small to justify purchasing better solutions.

With TinyPilot, there's enough money coming in to hire specialists where it makes sense. I enjoy being able to work with a talented dev team again after three years of coding by myself. I pay $200/month for dev tooling and CI without thinking twice about it because it's obviously a net cost savings to help my dev team eliminate gruntwork. In my previous businesses, paying for those tools would consume most of my revenue.

I enjoy having a company culture that matches what I always wanted to see from my employers. Everyone has flexible hours. There are no tight deadlines, so people can do their jobs well instead of rushing and compromising on quality. Almost all of our work is asynchronous, so everyone has the space to do [deep, focused work](/book-reports/deep-work/).

The hardest part for me about running a business with real customers is being responsible for failure. I have a team, but the buck ultimately stops with me. When I ship a bad bug or fail to launch a new product by the date I predicted, I find it painful and personally embarrassing. It's a completely different experience from being a developer at Microsoft or Google, where I shared blame with the people who reviewed and tested my work, and we were all eight layers removed from real customers.

Overall, I'm still happy to be working for myself and hope to sustain it for the rest of my working life.
