Six years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company.

For the first few years, all of my businesses flopped. None of them earned more than a few hundred dollars per month in revenue, and they all had negative profits.

Halfway through my third year, I created a device called [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com) that allows users to control their computers remotely without installing any software. The product quickly caught on, and it's been my main focus ever since.

In 2023, TinyPilot earned $200k in profit, a 10x increase from 2022. The business also generated $997k in profit, which, if you squint slightly, is a million dolllars.

In this post, I'll share what I've learned about being a bootstrapped founder from my sixth year doing it.

## Highlights from the year

### TinyPilot became 10x more profitable

### My most terrifying moment

In XX, I was getting ready. It was a lazy Saturday morning, and I heard a knock on my door. I opened it in my pajamas to see a guy in his mid-fifties. I didn't recognize him, but he was in jeans and a jacket.

"Are you the TinyPilot guy?" he asked me.

"Uh oh," I thought.

Was this a disgruntled customer who was mad about some product decision or team interaction? Was I about to be served a court order by a process server?

"Yes..." I said cautiously.

"I'm the handyman at the office. A sprinkler burst, and it flooded your office! You gotta get down there."

I got in my car and did the three-minute drive to the office, wondering if this was the end of my business. We assembled all of our hardware in that office, and we fulfilled all of our orders from there. I had insurance, but I had chosen coverage a year before when we carried lower inventory. And even if insurance paid out, TinyPilot would be dead in the water for three to six months until we could get replacement materials from our overseas manufacturers and start the whole manufacturing pipeline up again.

I got to the building and saw that, as the handyman said, the building was flooded. I walked to the second floor and saw that the carpets were soaked. But I noticed that the water had flowed not from TinyPilot's office but the conference room next door. I opened the door to TinyPilot's office, and everything was bone dry. The water hadn't even trickled past the door.

I breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed like instead of being out $100k and out of commission for a few days, we'd be shut down for maybe a week as they cleaned up the mess and fixed the sprinklers.

On Monday, I called our landlord to ask when we'd be able to get back into the office. He said casually that they were working on it, but we might have to move temporarily because the flood may have damaged our wall. I asked when the move would have to happen, and just as casually, he said it would probably be in the next few days, and he'd let me know.

Normally, being forced to move my entire office on a few days' notice would be disruptive, but it was _especially_ disruptive this week, as I was planning to take a two-week trip out of the country, my longest travel, by far, since starting TinyPilot. How was the team supposed to find a new office and move there while I was away?

Further, the office IT guy was me &mdash; nobody else knew how to set up our router, desktop, or print server if we were to move. And if they can't print shipping labels, they can't fulfill orders.

Fortunately, the landlord had a spare office in the same building, so I had just enough time before I left to move all of our computer equipment and get it set up before I left. And it turned out that they never had to tear down our wall anyway, so when I returned, I just put everything back.

The experience made me never want to be in that situation again, and it illustrated sharply just how much risk I was taking on by managing so much of TinyPilot's operations in a tiny office with just two part-time employees.

### A year of outsourcing

In XX, TinyPilot migrated its fulfillment to a third-party logistics (3PL) warehouse. They took over for

Our fulfillment had always been extremely smooth, which was why it took me so long to outsource it. In the past two years, the team had made maybe three total shipping errors out of about 3,500 orders. We advertised three business days of handling time, but 97% of orders went out within one business day.

When we shifted to the 3PL, we saved less time than I hoped, but it was a major reduction in stress. I didn't realize until we did it how stressful it was to make sure that the office was staffed and nothing was blocking us from fulfilling orders like an Internet outage, a disk failure on the office desktop, etc.

I hired a third part-time employee on a temporary basis. And even with three people, it was tough to keep up with orders.

Getting the new manufacturer up and running took XX months. They've worked out even better than we hoped. Our previous manufacturing partners have all been companies based in China. We found a US-based company with facilities overseas. They've been really hands-on in working with to improve aspects of the product, and they designed a retail box for us.

### TinyPilot looks like a real product now

It's been a 3D-printed case. I'd tried to find people to design a nicer box for the product, but it never came together, and it was never my top priority. But it definitely felt a little amateur that we shipped our product in a plain box with the device and all the cables just globbed together in a bubble-wrap pouch.

But now, it looks like a real thing. If someone were to do an unboxing video, I'd be happy to see them open it.

## Lessons learned

### Lesson 1

### Lesson 2

### Lesson 3

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-5/#goals-for-year-four) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

- **Result**: I mostly worked 40-hour weeks, a reduction from, and took a lot of time off
- **Grade**: B-

It's not 20 hours, but it's . I got married, took time off for my bachelor party and honeymoon, attended other family and friends' weddings. I attended Microconf and Handmade Seattle.

There were several week-long stretches where I was like, "Here's my emergency number if someone is physially injured or in danger." And fortunately, the phone never rang.

### Earn $100k in profit

- **Result**: Earned $200k in profit
- **Grade**: A+

### Close the TinyPilot office

- **Result**: We still have the office but it's non-critical
- **Grade**: B

## Goals for year six

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

I failed miserably at reducing my hours last year, but it's now my top priority. I'm hopeful about my chances this year. A lot of my 2022 work laid the groundwork to remove me from the critical path in 2023.

### Earn $100k in profit

For TinyPilot's first two and a half years, I focused on growth. I pay the same in hardware and software engineering costs whether I'm selling 20 devices per month or 2,000, so I needed to reach a certain scale to make the business viable.

For most of 2023, TinyPilot's production will be [constrained by supply](/retrospectives/2023/01/#losing-450k-in-a-single-email). It was disappointing to find out I'd have no chance at growing sales, but the silver lining is that I can slow down and focus on profit rather than growth.

TinyPilot has always roughly broken even, but I think I can reach $100k in profit this year if I avoid further hardware redesigns. Without the hardware redesigns in 2022, I would have saved around $100k on engineering and $20k on materials. If I keep sales steady and run leaner on the hardware side, 2023 should be a profitable year.

### Close the TinyPilot office

I've leased an office for TinyPilot [since early 2021](/retrospectives/2021/05/#tinypilots-new-office-the-fun-stuff). We use it for assembling devices, fulfilling orders, and storing inventory.

Having our own local office has helped us adapt quickly to changes in our hardware and processes, but it's a lot of extra overhead. This year, I hope to transition assembly to China, where all of our parts originate. I'm also in the process of moving our fulfillment to a third-party logistics warehouse.

Eliminating the TinyPilot office would spare us the work of maintaining a physical space, managing inventory, and tracking in-person shifts. Outsourcing manufacturing and fulfillment will also give the team more flexibility in time and location.

## Do I still love it?

Every year, when I write these blog posts, I ask myself whether I still love what I'm doing.

2022 was a hard year &mdash; certainly my hardest since going off on my own. I wasn't miserable, but I can't say I _loved_ it.

The global chip shortage meant we could never manufacture a batch of products the same way twice. There was always some missing component or manufacturing issue, so we were constantly racing to fix issues and adapt our processes before we ran out of stock. We got through it, and there were only a handful of days that I had to mark any product as sold out, but it was stressful.

That said, there were certainly many things to appreciate about the year. I had a relatively small amount of time for writing and software development, but I'm proud of what I produced. Expanding the TinyPilot organization and figuring out how teams work together grew my skills as a manager. It's been gratifying to see the team grow in their roles and expand their skills as the company evolves.

I still prefer working for myself to having an employer. I still feel grateful for the freedom to have my own company. And I still want to do it forever.
