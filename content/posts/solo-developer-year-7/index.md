## I sold my company

I kind of milked the story for all it's worth. I wrote about everything leading up to it as well as all the lessons I learned. And I went on some podcasts to talk about it more.

I'm still incredibly grateful for how it worked out. I don't

## I became a new parent

## I learned cool technologies

### Nix

The technology that's had the biggest impact on my work the last year is Nix. I like it so much that I started using NixOS as my only OS for both personal and work computing. This is after 30 years of mainly working from a Windows desktop.

The main feature of Nix I love is dev shells. You can create a custom environment

I create dev shells for all of my projects now. Whenever I'm contributing to an open-source project I don't maintain, I create my own private dev shell with all the project's dependencies.

A lot of people shy away from Nix because it's so complicated and difficult to learn, but what too few people realize is that you can use a lot of powerful features even if you're a dummy like me and understand about 2% of Nix. Once you see

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-6/#goals-for-year-seven) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

### Publish a course or book

### Write software for ten working hours per week

## Goals for next year

### Learn a new programming language

A lot of the people who I like are excited about Elixir and Phoenix, so I'm curious to try those.
