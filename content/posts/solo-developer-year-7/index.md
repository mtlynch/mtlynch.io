## I sold my company

I kind of milked the story for all it's worth. I wrote about everything leading up to it as well as all the lessons I learned. And I went on some podcasts to talk about it more.

## Grading last year's goals

Last year, I set [three high-level goals](/solo-developer-year-6/#goals-for-year-seven) that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Manage TinyPilot on 20 hours per week

### Publish a course or book

### Write software for ten working hours per week
