title: "My $6k Advance as a First-Time Technical Author"
date: 2025-04-25
---

I just received $5,946.92 in advance sales for [my first technical book](https://refactoringenglish.com) even though the book is only 25% complete, and I'm self-publishing it.

In March, I ran a three-week pre-sale for the book [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtlynch/refactoring-english). The pre-sale raised $6,551 from 191 customers. After Kickstarter's fees, I get $5,946.92, or 91% of the total.

I haven't seen many authors write books this way, so I thought I'd share more about how and why I crowdfunded my book.

## Benefits of crowdfunding a self-published book

- $6k is a higher advance than most traditional publishers offer to first-time authors.
- The money has no strings attached.
  - Even if I deliver late or fail to deliver entirely, I get to keep the money.
- The pre-sale gives me confidence that when I complete the book, I can find readers willing to purchase it.
- I didn't have to beg a publisher for permission to write my book.
- When I publish the book, I don't have to split sales with a publisher.
  - My only cost will be payment processor fees, so I'll only lose 3-13% in fees, depending on the platform.
- I still have the option to publish the same book with a traditional publisher in the future.

## My unfair advantages

One of my social media pet peeves is seeing posts like this:

> Wow, I put up a checkout form to let people pre-order my USB-powered flashlight. Within two hours, I'd made $100k! Business is so easy!

And then I check their profile, and they have 40M followers and a long track record of successful products.

So, I want to be upfront that I had advantages that helped my pre-sale succeed:

- My personal blog receives 300-500k unique readers per year.
- I'm atypically successful at writing articles that succeed [on Hacker News](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=mtlynch.io) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=url%3Amtlynch.io&sort=relevance&t=all).
  - During my pre-sale, an excerpt from my book gained [positive attention on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503872).
- I have 2.1k subscribers on my blog's mailing list and 1.5k subscribers for the book's mailing list.
  - There's surprisingly low overlap between the two lists, so it's about 3.5k subscribers, excluding duplicates.
- I have 9.2k followers on Twitter and 600 followers on Bluesky.

## How does crowdfunding compare to an advance from a traditional publisher?

Most publishers don't disclose the deals they offer to first-time authors, so it's difficult to say how my results compare generally.

No Starch Press is the most transparent publisher in terms of author pay. It offers three different royalty options to first-time authors:

- no advance, 15% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales
- $5k advance, 12% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales
- $8k advance, 10% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales

Manning doesn't publish their official rates for first-time authors, but Teiva Harsanyi [recently shared](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/100-go-mistakes) his experience publishing with Manning as a first time author. They paid him $2k upfront, $2k after delivering the first 1/3rd, and then 10% of sales. This earned him a total of $47k over four years (11,452 copies sold).

By self-publishing, I get a better deal on my advance, I can continue selling pre-orders as I write the book, and I still have the option to publish a future edition with a traditional publisher. The only person who I've seen talk about this is [Tracy Osborn](https://tracyosborn.com/), who originally self-published _Hello Web Design_ (great book), and then published [a second edition with No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hello-web-design).

## Worst-case: 200 people want to read my book

Writing a book is a risky venture. I expect it to take me 6-12 months. I'd be devastated to spend all that time writing and then find out at the end that nobody wanted to read my book in the first place.

A pre-sale guarantees that some people out there are interested in my book and are willing to pay for it.

With Kickstarter, you set a goal amount for the pre-sale. If you don't hit the goal, none of your customers pay anything, and you walk away with nothing.

Kicktarter's all-or-nothing sounds brutal, but I found it helpful. It allows protects me from an awkward "half-success" where pre-orders fall short of my expectations, and then I'm stuck either writing a book for a tiny readership or awkwardly refunding a bunch of pre-orders and eating tons of fees from my payment processor.

When I chose my pre-sale goal, I chose $5k because it's the lowest number where I'd feel satisfied earning that amount even if I never sold another copy beyond that. I'd of course like to sell more copies of my book later, but I'd still feel good about making $5k from a self-published book.

I priced the pre-orders at $25 per copy, so I figured that if 150 people bought, it would get me to $3,750, and then I'd make up the rest in the premium rewards like a public thank you or personalized writing feedback. The "worst case" would be if I reached the goal with everyone paying $25, but that still means 200 people want to read my book, which is pretty good.

## A pre-sale connects me with my most enthusiastic readers

People have a lot of opinions, and they feel like they're being helpful in sharing those opinions with you. But a lot of opinions people share with me are from people who would never buy the product they're talking about. Listening to these people is actually counterproductive because it's catering to the exact wrong audience.

The great thing about a pre-sale is that you suddenly have a direct line of communication to hundreds of people who are your target audience. Not only that, they're the early adopters, so they're the most enthusiastic to talk about it and give you feedback.

I don't want to write in a vacuum. I want to make sure what I'm writing makes readers feel like they got what they paid for and then some.

One benefit of the pre-sale is that I now have a great source of feedback about the book from real readers.

One of the things that inspired me to write a book was reading Rob Fitzpatrick's book, _Write Useful Books_. It's a guide to writing non-fiction books. Rob recommends that authors teach their material to students before writing the book. That way, they

I announced a live class. I got 14 sign-ups, and six attended, but that's who I want. Like the people that are most enthusiastic.

People were sharing the Kickstarter campaign on social media and encouraging others to support the book.

It turned out that a lot of them had been reading my writing for years.

One of the best things about the pre-sale.

Cool that I can offer an extra benefit to early customers.

## How did I find customers?

According to Kickstarter, here's how pre-sales for my book broke down:

| Source          | % of sales |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Book website    | 42%        |
| Kickstarter     | 12%        |
| Personal Blog   | 11%        |
| Twitter         | 4%         |
| Other / Unknown | 31%        |

I suspect that my mailing lists made up a large chunk of that "Unknown" category, but I forgot to use links in my newsletter that would have recorded the source of those purchases.

### Publishing book excerpts

The most effective way I found customers was by writing excerpts from the book and sharing them with my mailing lists and on social media. At the end of each post, I included a self-ad asking readers to help me expand the article into a full-length ebook:

{{<img src="self-ad.webp" max-width="325px" has-border="true" caption="Self-ads for the book that appeared at the bottom of my sample chapters online">}}

During the pre-sale, I published two new excerpts from the book. I published [the first](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/commit-messages/) at the start of the pre-sale to kick things off. I didn't finish [the second](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-developers-read/) until five days before the pre-sale ended.

Luckily, the second excerpt got traction [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503872) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/youq7y/how_write_blog_posts_developers_read), and readers from those sites doubled pre-orders for my book a matter of days. Without that second blog post, the pre-sale would have almost certainly fallen short of its $5k goal, and I'd have walked away with nothing.

### Advertising the book on my personal blog

Similar to the self-ad on the book's website, I added a little box at the bottom of all my blog post to say that I want to write a book and that readers can support it with a pre-order.

According to Kickstarter's analytics, 11% of pre-orders were from customers who discovered the book through my personal blog, so my blog provided a helpful boost.

## Which attempts at finding customers failed?

### Soliciting sponsorships from companies

I'm increasingly seeing open-source projects raise funding by displaying a company's logo on their website in exchange for a monthly donation. I thought, "Why not do the same thing with an ebook?"

But company sponsors didn't work. I reached out to ten companies, and none of the discussions went anywhere:

- One company offered $1k to buy a page in the book's acknowledgments section and a banner ad on the website.
  - I asked whether they'd be open to something time-limited, as I didn't want a "forever" obligation, and they stopped responding.
- One company was interested but then stopped responding when they realized I wanted them to purchase the sponsorship through Kickstarter.
- One company gave a quick, polite "no."
- One company responded weeks after the pre-sale had ended to decline.
- Six companies (the rest) never responded.

Part of the problem was that I waited until the last ten days of the pre-sale to reach out. At that point, it looked like my project was a flop.

I kept thinking I'd have a hit post during the pre-sale so that I could wow potential sponsors with flashy metrics about how many of my readers would see their logo, but I didn't have that until the end.

{{<img src="sponsor-email.webp" has-border="true" max-width="550px">}}

Even when the one company offered to sponsor for $1k, I didn't feel great about that because it felt like a single company carrying too much of the pre-sale. I expect that the number of pre-orders from regular readers to be predictive of how many customers purchase the book when I complete it. If I can't reach my pre-sale goal without one whale of a sponsor, that would have been a bad sign for long-term sales.

### Creating a web app to pander to Hacker News

I've often wondered who the most popular bloggers are on Hacker News, so, last summer, I wrote a quick and dirty tool to figure out the answer.

During the pre-sale, I realized the tool would be a good way to get attention from Hacker News. And people who care about the top Hacker News bloggers might also be interested in my book.

{{<img src="popularity-contest.webp" has-border="true" max-width="700px">}}

To lead visitors to the book, I put a prominent pre-order link in the navigation menu:

My blog ranks in the top 50 of all time, so I gave myself unique flair to lead readers to my book:

Hacker News did [get excited about the tool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43474505), and it reached [the top 10 for the day](https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2025-03-25) spot of the front page. [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), the 5th most popular blogger on Hacker News [wrote an article about my tool](https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/the_website_hacker_news_is_afraid_to_discuss).

Unfortunately, none of that attention translated to pre-orders. Sales were nearly zero the entire week that the blog ranking tool was most popular.

## What I'm glad I did

### Ran the pre-sale on Kickstarter

I was pleasantly surprised by Kickstarter. I kept waiting for the dark patterns and upsells to show up, but they never did.

I have a few quibbles with Kickstarter, but on the whole, it did what it said. It helped me raise a successful crowdfunding project, and it focused on that goal. It didn't try to milk me for money or pull any bait and switch tricks at the last minute.

I have [more detailed notes about Kickstarter](/notes/lessons-from-my-first-kickstarter/) for anyone interested in using that for a similar project.

### Edited my sample chapters to work as blog posts

As I started working on the book, I had a hard time picking which chapters to release as free samples. I wanted the samples to feel like standalone blog posts rather than an out-of-context chapter of a book. I kept struggling to find a chapter that would work both in a book and as a standalone article.

Finally, I realized that there's no rule saying that what I call an "excerpt" has to 100% match what appears in the book. I could adapt the material however I wanted to fit the format of a standalone blog post.

For example, I presented ["How to Write Blog Posts that Developers Read"](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-developers-read/) as a single article on the book's website, but in the full book, I plan to split that material across several chapters so I can expand on those ideas.

### Underpromised on rewards

When Tracy Osborn used Kickstarter to offer pre-orders for her first book, one of the rewards she offered was home baked-cookies. But then when her Kickstarter finished, and she [felt stressed having to bake and ship hundreds cookies](https://hellowebbooks.com/news/reviewing-hello-web-apps-kickstarter-campaign/).

I definitely felt the temptation to offer better, more eye-catching rewards for pre-ordering. Especially as sales slowed down partway through the month, desperation set in and I wondered what I could offer to reach my $5k goal.

I considered promising signed copies of the book, but that meant committing to a print run and shipping physical products, which is months of work in itself.

Looking back, I'm relieved that I didn't cave to my desperation. I still feel good about everything I offered and the prices I accepted for them.

## What I wish I'd done differently

### Offered an "I just want to give you extra money" option

I recently attended a talk that [Aaron Francis](https://aaronfrancis.com/) gave about creating educational software videos. He [offers a course](https://screencasting.com) on this topic for $300, but he also sells a premium $1k package that includes a 40-minute 1:1 video call with him.

After the talk, I asked Aaron if those $1k customers pressure him to deliver something outstanding or unreasonable on those calls. Surprisingly, Aaron said that he experienced the opposite.

When customers paid $1k to get a 1:1 call with him, he found that they "somewhat want help, somewhat just want to hang out." The $1k customers treated the package as a generous tip. "It's like I turned the iPad around, and they tipped $1,000."

I thought about offering something like a 1:1 call as part of my pre-sale, but I figured that if someone wanted to pay me above my asking price for the book, Kickstarter already offers that option. Or they could buy one of the premium rewards like a personalized writing review.

In retrospect, I should have offered a 1:1 call for something like $300-500. Getting a 1:1 call feels different than just paying above the asking price and getting nothing in return, so there might have been people interested in that option.

### Started with my most excerpt-able material

I wrote "Passive Voice Considered Harmful" and realized it's a useful book chapter, but it's not an exciting excerpt. There's rarely a viral article that everyone's obsessing over about the passive voice.
