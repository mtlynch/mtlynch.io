title: "My $6k Advance as a First-Time Technical Author"
date: 2025-04-18
---

I'm working on [my first technical book](https://refactoringenglish.com), and I just received $5,946.92 in advance sales, even though the book is only 25% complete, and I'm self-publishing it.

In March, I ran a three-week pre-sale for the book on Kickstarter. The pre-sale raised $6,551 from 191 customers. After Kickstarter's fees, I get $5,946.92, or 91% of the total.

There are a lot of advantages to pre-selling the book this way:

- $6k is higher than most traditional publishers offer to first-time authors.
- The pre-sale gives me confidence early in the process that readers are willing to pay for this book.
- I now have a group of early readers who are enthusiastic to provide early feedback about the book, as they already have skin in the game.
- I didn't have to jump through hoops with a publisher.
- The money has no strings attached.
  - Even if I deliver late or entirely fail to deliver, the money is still mine.
- When I publish the book, I don't have to split sales with a publisher.
  - My only cost will be commissions on whatever payment platform I choose, so I'll receive 85-95% of what customers pay.
- I still have the option to publish the same book with a traditional publisher in the future.

I haven't seen many authors write books this way, so I thought I'd share more about how and why I did this.

## My unfair advantages

One of my pet peeves is seeing people on social media post things like, "Wow, I just launched this silly idea, and I've already made $100k in pre-orders. Business is so easy!" And then I check their profile, and they have 10M followers and a long track record of successful products.

So, I want to be upfront that I had some advantages that made my pre-sale succeed, but I still think that most of what I did is repeatable.

- I've been blogging for nine years.
- I have a mailing list of XX subscribers on my personal blog.
- The book has its own mailing list that had XX subscribers when I started the pre-sale.
  - There's overlap between the two. There are at most XX unique subscribers between the two.
- I have XX followers on Twitter

## Why a pre-sale?

My biggest fear was spending a year writing a book only to find out afterwards that nobody wants to read it. The pre-sale was a way to confirm that there truly were readers out there interested enough in the topic to pay money.

## How does this compare to what traditional publishers pay?

Most publishers don't disclose the deals they make with first-time authors, so it's difficult to say how my results compare.

No Starch Press pays up to $8k, but it reduces your royalties to just 10% of sales.

Manning doesn't publish current rates for first-time authors, but Teiva Harsanyi [recently shared](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/100-go-mistakes) that Manning paid him a $4k advance.

The cool thing about self-publishing is that you still have the option to publish a future edition with a traditional publisher. The only person who I've seen talk about this is _Tracy Osborn_, who originally self-published _Hello Web Design_ (great book), and then published [a second edition with No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hello-web-design).

## Where did my customers come from?

TODO

## What I'm glad I did

### Used Kickstarter for the pre-sale

I considered selling the pre-orders directly through a platform like Stripe or PayPal. I ended up choosing Kickstarter, and I'm glad I did for a few reasons.

First, Kickstarter does a good job of letting customers and authors share risk.

Normally, an author assumes nearly all the risk of writing a book. It takes months or years to complete a book. Lots of things can come up in that time that prevent the author from completing the book, in which case, they receive no compensation for years of work.

If I tried to sell pre-orders through PayPal and then something happened where the book was late or I couldn't complete it, customers could complain to PayPal and say I didn't hold up my end of the deal, and I'm a fraud, and I should be in the "no compensation for months of work" category.

Kickstarter lets customers take on the risk instead of the author.

With Kickstarter, customers technically are not purchasing the book but rather inside access to the process of writing it. They're buying a 90% chance (or less, depending on their faith in me) that I'll deliver a book by the end of the year. And as a reward for the risk, they get a discounted price, early access to the book, and a voice in the book's direction.

What happens if something happens, and I can't finish the book?

- Do I walk away with zero?
- Do I have to negotiate with everyone about how much they think is fair for me to keep?
- Do I have to deal with a whole mess of headaches trying to give people refunds six months after the fact?

The thing that Kickstarter does well is set expectations around uncertainty.

TODO: You're along for the ride.

Beyond that, Kickstarter found some customers for me.

Finally, I appreciated that Kickstarter

### Picked a funding target that would make me excited to write the book

I set a crowdfunding goal of $5k. I thought it would be difficult to reach that goal, but I picked a number where, even if I make no further sales, I'd still feel satisfied writing a book for that amount of money.

I'm still in the honeymoon phase, so hopefully I still feel that way when the book is done.

### Published excerpts during the pre-sale

I published two sample chapters before the pre-sale, and two more during the pre-sale. Looking back, I wish I'd published them all during the pre-sale, but that's only with the benefit of hindsight. It made sense to start publishing book excerpts in a low-pressure way just to see if there was any interest.

### Offering premium rewards

I offered pre-orders of the book for $25 as the standard item in the Kickstarter, but I also offered other options for people who wanted to contribute more:

- $75: Your name and a link on the website, plus a thank you in the first edition of the book.
- $150: Personalized writing feedback on a blog post or draft.
  - I originally priced this at $300 and nobody bought, but four people purchased after I reduced the price to $150.
- $150: Team license to the book for up to 10 people within an organization.

### Avoided offering forever placement in the book

One path I want to keep open is potentially republishing this book later with a tech publisher like No Starch Press. There are a lot of authors who self-published a book and then did a second edition with a publisher, and that seems like the best of both worlds.

So, given that I might do a second edition with a publisher, I didn't want to commit to something like, "Backers will always be mentioned by name in the book," because I don't know if that will complicate things if I eventually go to a publisher and bring them these requirements. I made sure to say that I'd thank backers specifically in the first edition, though I'll try to keep them in forever.

### Self-ads

The pledge meter was maybe helpful. I was just manually updating it.

Although some people gave me feedback that they read the article and didn't realize they could pre-order the book.

### Start early

I was able to get my Kickstarter up and running quickly, but I'm glad I gave myself lead time for Kickstarter to verify my banking information, as that took a few days and required giving a bunch of documentation to Stripe, Kickstarter's payment provider.

### Looked at other non-fiction book projects

### Didn't overinvest in a slick presentation

You can spend infinite time polishing a presentation and making an amazing video. If you're good at that, that's a good edge, but I just wanted to see if anyone was interested in my book, so I didn't want to spend weeks and weeks making a jaw-dropping Kickstarter page only to find out that nobody was interested in the book to begin with.

### Adapted chapters to the blog format

Early in writing, I was struggling with how to write chapters I could publish for free that would drive attention to the book.

The problem is that a standalone blog post is different from a chapter that's part of a book.

And then I realized the obvious thing: I don't have to publish material the same way in a sample chapter and the actual book. I can just call the free preview an "excerpt" and edit it however I want to work well as a blog post.

So, for example, my article, "How to Write Blog Posts that Developers Read" is going to be organized differently in the real book, but that's fine.

## What I wish I'd done differently

### Started with my most excerpt-able chapters

I wrote "Passive Voice Considered Harmful" and realized it's a useful book chapter, but it's not an exciting excerpt. There's rarely a viral article that everyone's obsessing over about the passive voice.

### Enabled late pledges

Kickstarter has a surprising behavior where you stop being able to edit certain things at surprising times. For example, once a customer purchases a reward tier. And once the fundraising window ends, you can't enable late pledges.

Apparently they were enabled for my project but not per-item. And then you can't flip them on after without talking to support, but it meant losing momentum.

### Collected better data about what led customers to order

Kickstarter can analyze UTM parameters, but I never added them to any of my links. It probably would have been helpful to know which readers came from my personal blog vs. the book's website vs. the mailing list. They collect data based on the HTTP referer header, but that's not as reliable as UTM parameters.

### Focused on people rather than companies

Again, with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to say I should have skipped soliciting sponsors, but I think the decision made sense at the time.

But even when the one company offered to sponsor for $1k, I didn't feel great about that because it felt like a single company carrying too much of the pre-sale. I expect that the number of pre-orders from regular readers to be predictive of how many customers purchase the finished book, so if I can only sell $3k to regular people, that would have been a bad sign for long-term sales.

### Created more sensible reward tiers

One thing I screwed up in creating the rewards was that I didn't include the book itself in the $75 personal sponsor. So a few people purchased the $75 tier and then were surprised to realize it technically doesn't include the book itself. And once someone has purchased a reward, I can't edit it, even to add items. So, my workaround was just to tell people

## Other notes

### Kickstarter projects attract spam

I got [a ton of spam](/retrospectives/2025/03/#except-for-kickstarter-spammers) from companies trying to "help out" with my presale.

Just be aware of this when you start a Kickstarter. Even though my email isn't in the Kickstarter itself, they found my email address by digging through the book website and then my personal blog.

Fortunately, there's a big surge in spam for the first week of the campaign, and then nothing more after that.
