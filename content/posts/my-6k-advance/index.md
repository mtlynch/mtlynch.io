title: "My $6k Advance as a First-Time Technical Author"
date: 2025-04-25
---

I just received $5,946.92 in advance sales for [my first technical book](https://refactoringenglish.com) even though the book is only 25% complete, and I'm self-publishing it.

{{<img src="kickstarter-payout.webp" max-width="650px" has-border="true">}}

In March, I ran a three-week pre-sale for the book [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtlynch/refactoring-english). The pre-sale raised $6,551 from 191 customers. After Kickstarter's fees, I get $5,946.92, or 91% of the total.

I haven't seen many authors write books this way, so I thought I'd share more about how and why I crowdfunded my book.

## Benefits of crowdfunding a self-published book

- $6k is a higher advance than most traditional publishers offer to first-time authors.
- The money has no strings attached.
  - Even if I deliver late or fail to deliver entirely, the money is still mine.
- The pre-sale gives me confidence that when I complete the book, I can find readers willing to purchase it.
- I didn't have to beg a publisher for permission to write my book.
- When I publish the book, I don't have to split sales with a publisher.
  - My only cost will be payment processor fees, so I'll only lose 3-13% in fees, depending on the platform.
- I still have the option to publish the same book with a traditional publisher in the future.

## My unfair advantages

One of my social media pet peeves is seeing posts like this:

> Wow, I put up a basic checkout form to pre-order my USB-powered flashlight. Two hours later, I had $100k in pre-orders! Business is so easy!

And then I check their profile, and they have 40M followers and a long track record of successful products.

So, I want to be upfront that I had some advantages that helped my pre-sale succeed:

- I've been blogging for nine years.
- I'm atypically successful at writing articles that succeed [on Hacker News](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=mtlynch.io) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=url%3Amtlynch.io&sort=relevance&t=all).
  - During my pre-sale, an excerpt from my book gained [positive attention on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43503872).
- I have 2k subscribers on my blog's mailing list and XX subscribers for the book's mailing list.
  - There's heavy overlap between the two lists.
  - There are at most XX unique subscribers between the two mailing lists.
- I have 9.2k followers on Twitter and 600 followers on Bluesky.

That said, I'm not especially online famous, so I think that most of what I did is repeatable.

## A pre-sale protects me from writing a book nobody wants

Writing a book is a long commitment. I don't want to spend a year writing a book only to find out afterwards that nobody wants to read it.

My book is called _Refactoring English_. It's a book that aims to teach writing specifically to software developers. A lot of people say they want to improve their writing, but that's different from being willing to invest actual money into a book about it.

The pre-sale was a way to confirm that there were readers out there interested enough in my book to purchase it.

I set a crowdfunding goal of $5k. I thought it would be difficult to reach that goal, but I picked a number where, even if I make no further sales, I'd still feel satisfied writing a book for that amount of money.

## How did I find customers?

### Publishing book excerpts

The most effective way I found customers was by writing excerpts from the book and sharing them with my mailing lists and on social media. At the end of each post, I included a self-ad for the pre-sale that invited readers to help me expand the article they just read into a full-length ebook:

{{<img src="self-ad.webp" max-width="325px" has-border="true" caption="Self-ads for the book that appeared at the bottom of my sample chapters online">}}

During the pre-sale, I published two new excerpts from the book. I published one right at the start of the pre-sale. I didn't finish the second excerpt until five days before the pre-sale ended. Luckily, the second excerpt got traction on Hacker News and Lobsters, and readers from those sites doubled pre-orders for my book in a few days.

## Which attempts at finding customers failed?

### Soliciting sponsorships from companies

A lot of open-source projects have found a way of funding where they display a company's logo on their website in exchange for some monthly donation.

I thought, "Why not do the same thing with an ebook?" I didn't mind showing some companies' logos on my book's website if it will help me reach my $5k goal.

But company sponsors didn't work. I reached out to ten companies, and none of the discussions went anywhere:

- One company offered $1k to buy a page in the book's acknowledgments section and a banner ad on the website.
  - I asked whether they'd be open to something time-limited, as I didn't want a "forever" obligation, and they stopped responding.
- One company was interested but then stopped responding when they realized I wanted them to purchase the sponsorship through Kickstarter.
- One company gave a quick, polite "no."
- Seven companies (the rest) never responded.

Part of the problem was that I waited until the last ten days of the pre-sale to reach out, and at that point, it looked like my project was a flop. I kept thinking I'd have a hit post during the pre-sale so that I could wow potential sponsors with flashy metrics about how many of my readers would see their logo, but I didn't have that until the end.

{{<img src="sponsor-email.webp" has-border="true" max-width="550px">}}

Again, with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to say I should have skipped soliciting sponsors, but I think the decision made sense at the time.

Even when the one company offered to sponsor for $1k, I didn't feel great about that because it felt like a single company carrying too much of the pre-sale. I expect that the number of pre-orders from regular readers to be predictive of how many customers purchase the finished book, so if I can only sell $3k to regular people, that would have been a bad sign for long-term sales.

### Creating a web app to pander to Hacker News

I've often wondered who the most popular bloggers are on Hacker News, so I wrote a quick and dirty tool last summer to figure out the answer. And then I became a father and shelved the tool.

But during the pre-sale, I realized the tool would be a good way to get attention from Hacker News, and people who care about the top Hacker News bloggers might also be interested in a book about improving their writing.

To lead visitors to the book, I put a prominent pre-order link in the navigation menu:

I rank in the top 50 of all time in the list, and I gave myself unique flair to lead readers to my book:

Hacker News did get excited about the tool, and it reached the XX spot of the front page. John Gruber, the XXth most popular blogger on Hacker News to write an article about my tool.

Unfortunately, none of it translated to pre-orders. Pre-orders the week that the ranking tool received attention were almost zero.

## How does crowdfunding compare to an advance from a traditional publisher?

Most publishers don't disclose the deals they make with first-time authors, so it's difficult to say how my results compare.

No Starch Press is the most transparent publisher in terms of author pay. It offers three different royalty options to first-time authors:

- no advance, 15% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales
- $5k advance, 12% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales
- $8k advance, 10% royalties on print sales, 25% royalties on ebook sales

Manning doesn't publish current rates for first-time authors, but Teiva Harsanyi [recently shared](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/100-go-mistakes) his experience publishing with Manning as a first time author. They paid him $2k upfront, $2k after delivering the first 1/3rd, and then 10% of sales for a total of $47k over four years (11,452 copies sold).

Even though my initial pre-sale is over, I'm still selling pre-orders for the book for a slightly higher price. I've had 14 more sales for a total of $520. I plan to continue offering pre-orders until I complete the book with a bigger discount the earlier that customers order.

Best of all, I still have the option to publish a future edition with a traditional publisher. The only person who I've seen talk about this is _Tracy Osborn_, who originally self-published _Hello Web Design_ (great book), and then published [a second edition with No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hello-web-design).

I'm not sure how many publishers are willing to re-publish a book that the author previously self-published, but _No Starch Press_ and _Manning_ both confirmed to me that they regularly do this.

## A pre-sale connects me with my most enthusiastic customers

One benefit of the pre-sale is that I now have a great source of feedback about the book from real readers.

One of the things that inspired me to write a book was reading Rob Fitzpatrick's book, _Write Useful Books_. It's a guide to writing non-fiction books. Rob recommends that authors teach their material to students before writing the book. That way, they

I announced a live class. I got 14 sign-ups, and six attended, but that's who I want. Like the people that are most enthusiastic.

It turned out that a lot of them had been reading my writing for years.

One of the best things about the pre-sale.

Cool that I can offer an extra benefit to early customers.

## Underpromise and overdeliver

When Tracy Osborn created a Kickstarter, she

- I didn't

## I'm pleasantly surprised with Kickstarter

### Pro: No upsells, no dark patterns

I've tried a lot of other "creator platforms" and it quickly becomes obvious that the platform is trying to milk creators every step of the way.

### Pro: Sets good expectations around risk

### Used Kickstarter for the pre-sale

I considered selling the pre-orders directly through a platform like Stripe or PayPal. I ended up choosing Kickstarter, and I'm glad I did for a few reasons.

First, Kickstarter does a good job of letting customers and authors share risk.

Normally, an author assumes nearly all the risk of writing a book. It takes months or years to complete a book. Lots of things can come up in that time that prevent the author from completing the book, in which case, they receive no compensation for years of work.

If I tried to sell pre-orders through PayPal and then something happened where the book was late or I couldn't complete it, customers could complain to PayPal and say I didn't hold up my end of the deal, and I'm a fraud, and I should be in the "no compensation for months of work" category.

Kickstarter lets customers take on the risk instead of the author.

With Kickstarter, customers technically are not purchasing the book but rather inside access to the process of writing it. They're buying a 90% chance (or less, depending on their faith in me) that I'll deliver a book by the end of the year. And as a reward for the risk, they get a discounted price, early access to the book, and a voice in the book's direction.

What happens if something happens, and I can't finish the book?

- Do I walk away with zero?
- Do I have to negotiate with everyone about how much they think is fair for me to keep?
- Do I have to deal with a whole mess of headaches trying to give people refunds six months after the fact?

The thing that Kickstarter does well is set expectations around uncertainty.

TODO: You're along for the ride.

Beyond that, Kickstarter found some customers for me.

Finally, I appreciated that Kickstarter

### Pro: I succeeded even with an amateurish profile

You can spend infinite time making a Kickstarter project. Some projects have intro videos and testimonials that look like they took months to create.

I didn't want to do that.

Mainly because I don't enjoy working on that kind of stuff, but also because I didn't want to do all that stuff before I even knew if anyone wanted this book.

In total, I spent 5-10 hours on my Kickstarter project. I was able to recycle a lot of the material that was already on my website. I made a short intro video because that's what other people seemed to do and it felt like a good way to demonstrate that I'm a real person and this isn't just an AI-generated money grab. The video only took me about 90 minutes. I just wrote a short script, memorized it, and then recorded it about ten times until I had a take I liked.

You can spend infinite time polishing a presentation and making an amazing video. If you're good at that, that's a good edge, but I just wanted to see if anyone was interested in my book, so I didn't want to spend weeks and weeks making a jaw-dropping Kickstarter page only to find out that nobody was interested in the book to begin with.

### Con: Spammers will find you

### Con: Late p

### Con: Kickstarter payouts are confusing

### Con: Kickstarter assumes physical products

### Con: Kickstarter ties your hands in some places

Can't change price.

### Tip: Allocate time for bank verification

### Tip: Set the delivery date to the slowest item in the reward tier

### Offering premium rewards

I offered pre-orders of the book for $25 as the standard item in the Kickstarter, but I also offered other options for people who wanted to contribute more:

- $75: Your name and a link on the website, plus a thank you in the first edition of the book.
- $150: Personalized writing feedback on a blog post or draft.
  - I originally priced this at $300 and nobody bought, but four people purchased after I reduced the price to $150.
- $150: Team license to the book for up to 10 people within an organization.

### Avoided offering forever placement in the book

One path I want to keep open is potentially republishing this book later with a tech publisher like No Starch Press. There are a lot of authors who self-published a book and then did a second edition with a publisher, and that seems like the best of both worlds.

So, given that I might do a second edition with a publisher, I didn't want to commit to something like, "Backers will always be mentioned by name in the book," because I don't know if that will complicate things if I eventually go to a publisher and bring them these requirements. I made sure to say that I'd thank backers specifically in the first edition, though I'll try to keep them in forever.

### Start early

I was able to get my Kickstarter up and running quickly, but I'm glad I gave myself lead time for Kickstarter to verify my banking information, as that took a few days and required giving a bunch of documentation to Stripe, Kickstarter's payment provider.

### Looked at other non-fiction book projects

### Limited to ebook PDF format

I know I can produce an ebook as a PDF.

I _think_ I can also produce an epub version.

And I could figure out printing a physical version, but I expect that alone is several weeks of risk. If all goes well, my plan is to never deal directly with print versions or selling on Amazon and just work with a publisher to handle that for a second edition.

### Adapted chapters to the blog format

As I started working on the book, I had a hard time picking which chapters to release as free samples. I wanted to publish chapters that felt like regular blog posts that you'd find on Hacker News or reddit, but how I'd present material in a blog post is different from how I wanted it to appear in the book.

And then I finally realized I can adapt the material however I want between the free web excerpts and the book. For example, the web excerpt of, "How to Write Blog Posts that Developers Read" is one article, but in the book, I'm going to split the material across a few chapters and expand more on some of the subjects. I suspect that none of my readers are going to say, "Hey! This chapter of the book isn't word-for-word what I saw in the excerpt, so I want my money back!"

Personally, I'm disappointed when I buy a book, and it's just a bunch of blog posts taped together with some light editing. I want my book to feel like a cohesive book and not like a collection of independent essays.

## What I wish I'd done differently

### Enabled late pledges

Kickstarter has a surprising behavior where you stop being able to edit certain things at surprising times. For example, once a customer purchases a reward tier. And once the fundraising window ends, you can't enable late pledges.

Apparently they were enabled for my project but not per-item. And then you can't flip them on after without talking to support, but it meant losing momentum.

### Offered an "I just want to give you extra money" option

I recently attended a talk that Aaron Francis gave about creating educational technical videos. I asked him about pricing because he sells [his course](https://screencasting.com) for $300, but he offered a premium $1k option that included a 40-minute 1:1 video call with him.

At the talk, I asked Aaron if he feels pressure on those $1k calls to deliver something outstanding, as I'd imagine customers who paid $1k for a 40-minute call might feel entitled to something unreasonable.

Surprisingly, Aaron said that he experienced the opposite. When customers paid $1k to get a 1:1 call with him, he found that they "somewhat want help, somewhat just want to hang out." His sense was the $1k customers chose that package as a generous tip. "It's like I turned the iPad around, and they tipped $1,000."

I thought about offering something like a 1:1 call, but I figured that if someone wanted to pay me above the asking price, Kickstarter lets them do that. And they could always buy something like a personalized writing review.

In retrospect, I think I should have offered a 1:1 call for something like $400-500. I think there might have been people interested in that option who weren't interested in having me review their writing or just overpaying for the book.

### Collected better data about what led customers to order

Kickstarter can analyze UTM parameters, but I never added them to any of my links. It probably would have been helpful to know which readers came from my personal blog vs. the book's website vs. the mailing list. They collect data based on the HTTP referer header, but that's not as reliable as UTM parameters.

### Included the book in every reward tier

I find Kickstarter's tier system pretty confusing. There are two components to it: there are reward items and reward tiers. An item is a thing like an ebook or a shoutout on the website. An item can appear in one or more reward tiers.

That makes sense, right?

Here's where it gets confusing: the rewards also have descriptions and delivery dates, but they're on the _tiers_ not the items. So if I have a tier that

One thing I screwed up in creating the rewards was that I didn't include the book itself in the $75 personal sponsor. So a few people purchased the $75 tier and then were surprised to realize it technically doesn't include the book itself. And once someone has purchased a reward, I can't edit it, even to add items. So, my workaround was just to tell people

### Started with my most excerpt-able material

I wrote "Passive Voice Considered Harmful" and realized it's a useful book chapter, but it's not an exciting excerpt. There's rarely a viral article that everyone's obsessing over about the passive voice.

## Kickstarter projects attract spam

One thing to be aware of if you offer a project on Kickstarter: spammers will immediately swarm you. I got emails from about ten different spammers offering to ["help out" with my presale](/retrospectives/2025/03/#except-for-kickstarter-spammers). Even though my email isn't in the Kickstarter itself, they found my email address by digging through the book website and then finding my contact information on my personal blog.

Annoyingly, a few of the spammers pose as interested customers, so they'll keep asking one vague question per email about the product until they eventually offer to introduce you to their friend who's good at Kickstarter.

I had a big surge in spam for the first week of the campaign, but then no new outreach after that, though the original spammers kept pestering me to respond.
