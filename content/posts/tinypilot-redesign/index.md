title: "Things I Wish I'd Known Before Spending $46k on a Website Redesign"

I created my company's site when I first launched the business. It was meant to be a placeholder until I hired a real designer to make a decent site. A year later, my business was earning $XXk/month in revenue, and the website still looked like it was advertising someone's hobby project.

My company was still small and bootstrapped, so I budgeted $10-15k over two or three months for a redesign. I wasn't aiming for the world's most awe-inspiring e-commerce site, just a less embarrassing one than I had. Here's the final result:

TODO: Final screenshot

Except it didn't take $10k and two months. It took $46k, eight months, and massive stress.

Now that the project is over, I'm revisiting what happened and what mistakes I made hiring a web design agency so that you don't fall into the same trap.

## My experience with hiring

If you're assuming that I'm an idiot who let a design agency take advantage of them, it's worth noting that this is not my first rodeo. I definitely made mistakes in this project, but this was not my first time hiring outside help for a project.

I've hired dozens of freelancers, including developers, artists, writers, and editors. I've never hired an agency, but I've worked with web design agencies at previous jobs.

I don't think the agency I worked with on this project was evil or deceptive. They seemed like they made a good-faith effort to deliver the results I wanted, but we were just mismatched. I didn't have enough experience hiring agencies, and they didn't have enough experience working for a bootstrapped software developer.

I'm not trying to shame the agency who did this project, so I'll just call them "WebAgency."

## How I chose WebAgency

At the start of this process, I started looking for agencies. The problem with being a bootstrapped founder is that if you can find them by Googling "web design agency," they're about 10x too expensive for you. So it's hard to find people that match your size. I asked for recommendations and searched on sites like Indie Hackers and Hacker News.

I interviewed four freelancers and one agency. WebAgency immediately stood out as the best. Their portfolio showed a variety of styles that they executed well, and they had lots of different expertise in-house, so they could do design, development, animations, and 3D images if I needed them.

What's more, WebAgency's CEO suggested I reduce the project scope. He said that instead of a full-blown redesign, I should just start with a rebranding. WebAgency would create a new logo and work with me to select a new color scheme and fonts for the site. From there, I could measure results, and the branding would let me start working with digital marketing agencies. That sounded smart!

WebAgency's CEO estimated that the rebrand would require 30-40 billable hours over two to four weeks at their hourly rate $175/hour. So, $5-7k for new logo and branding felt reasonable to me. If the rebrand improved TinyPilot's sales, I could start a monthly retainer with WebAgency and have them polish design in other areas of TinyPilot.

WebAgency's CEO did warn me that I was smaller than most of their other clients. Most of their clients have them on long-term retainer agreements. This project was so tightly-scoped that we could do it hourly, but there was a possibility that they'd have to pause my work occasionally if a retainer client needed more time.

## The honeymoon period

The first month of the project was fantastic.

WebAgency's CEO was on all the calls, as well as the company's lead designer, a senior designer, and a project manager. They'd show me samples of the new logos and branding. I told them what I liked and disliked about the options. They took my feedback graciously, and the next round, we'd be a little closer.

After three or four rounds of feedback, we landed on a logo concept we all liked:

TODO: Show logo draft

## The first red flag: scope creep

In parallel with the logo, WebAgency started doing mockups of my site with different fonts and colors. At first, the website was essentially my existing website, but as we continued to meet, the designs got more elaborate.

Sometimes, we'd meet, and there would be no change to the logos or branding. They just wanted to show me design ideas for the website.

"To be clear, this project is still just the rebranding, right?," I asked them.

"Oh, yes, yes," they reassured me. "Some branding choices won't make sense on top of the old design, so these are just quick sketches of how they could look."

But then it just continued. I was desperate to have the new logo because once that was done, I could put it on the sales site, my product's web app, and on the physical device's case. But instead of finalizing the last 10% of the logo, they just kept redesigning the website.

The breaking point was when they started showing me new designs for my site's blog. From the beginning, I had said that I only cared about the purchase flow, and all other pages were explicitly out of scope.

I emailed the CEO, and he called me. He was embarrassed that the designers had gotten off track. He admitted that the designers went beyond just sketching. He said they were just so excited about the project that they got carried away and designed more than they should have, but he was going to remove the hours for the out of scope work.

I didn't like that they had gone beyond the scope of the rebrand, but I reasoned that they were doing quality work, and I'd probably work with them in the future anyway, so why not do it.

## The two-month holiday slowdown

Starting in December, WebAgency's work slowed down. A lot.

They stopped scheduling calls to review work with me. They occasionally shared updates over email, but comments I left on their designs sat ignored for weeks.

At the time, I chalked it up to the holidays. Lots of people are on vacation in December, so I assumed things would pick back up in the new year.

The slow pace continued into January. And not only was the pace slow, the quality of the work degraded.

When the project started, we communicated effectively. I'd give them feedback on the designs, and they'd integrate my feedback. But now, when I'd mention something like insufficient contrast between a text field and its surrounding color, it took three back-and-forths before they understood what I was saying.

## "I don't know when we'll have the hours to finish"

I emailed the CEO to ask what was going on. We had a call, and he apologized for the way the project was going. He admitted that things were bumpy internally at WebAgency. Their project manager quit in November, and the CEO was scrambling to cover those duties while also interviewing replacements.

The reason I was seeing the degradation in quality was that they were busy with other clients. WebAgency _really_ wanted to work with me, but I was their only hourly client. They had to prioritize the retainer clients that made a long-term commitment to them.

I said I understood I was a small client to them. I was willing to wait a few weeks until their other work slowed down. We both agreed that there were probably only 10-15 hours of design work left. I just wanted them to be high-quality October hours and not the harried, squeeze time in between other things hours I saw in December and January.

"We'll definitely finish your project. I just don't know when we'll have the hours." I asked if it would be done by March, and he said he wasn't sure.

WebAgency's CEO did, however, have an idea for how we could complete the project quickly.

## The solution is to pay more

The real issue, WebAgency's CEO, said was that I was their only hourly client. I would always be at risk of their long-term retainer clients pre-empting my project. So what if I signed a retainer agreement to hire them long-term?

My initial reaction was outrage. The solution to them doing a poor job was that I have to make an even bigger commitment to them and give them even more money? And if a retainer was better for everyone, why didn't they just ask me to switch back in November? If my project went off the rails because of problems at WebAgency, why was I absorbing the cost?

The CEO agreed that it was unfair. He told me he'd retroactively adjust my December and January bills as if I'd been on a retainer agreement and refund the difference. And he said the offer stood even if I walked away at that point.

The CEO did emphasize the benefits of the retainer. TinyPilot's developers had started to implement parts of the design like the new header and footer, and it had gone poorly. They mainly worked in JavaScript and Python, so implementing existing designs in CSS wasn't their strong suit. Even though they were significantly more expensive than TinyPilot's developers, they'd cost less overall since they're so experienced at exactly the tasks I needed.

The retainer agreement only had a 28-day notice requirement, so if it didn't work out, I was only on the hook to pay them for one more month.

## Start over or push through?

WebAgency put me in a tough position. Now, I had a decision to make. Do I dig myself even deeper with WebAgency by signing the retainer agreement? Do I wait indefinitely for them to find time for me on an hourly contract? Or do I hire someone else to finish the work?

All the designs were around 80% done, but nothing was usable. The logo still needed some adjustments. The desktop versions of the page redesigns were 80-90% done, but they hadn't started the mobile versions. I couldn't hand things to TinyPilot's dev team to begin work. I was four months and $XXk into what was supposed to be a six-week project.

I had seen WebAgency do excellent work, but I'd also seen them do poor work. Would the retainer get me back to the excellent work? It sounded plausible.

Switching designers would have been incredibly difficult. I've seen what happens when one person tries to finish a project that someone else claimed was 80% done. The results are never good.

I was in the middle of launching a new product, and I barely had time to do my current work. I didn't have time to search, interview, and onboard a new agency or freelancer.

And to be honest, I didn't have time to fuss with anything. I was dealing with the mayhem of launching a new product (TODO: link) and making sure all of our internal workflows were ready to fulfill orders. I just wanted to do the thing that would minimize my time, and that was to just stick with them. It seemed like the design work was mostly 85% done anyway, so why not just spend a few hours on the last 15%?

I signed the retainer. My good, protected hours were scheduled to resume in March.

## Not like other dev work

We were off to a good start. Within the first week of my retainer month, they wrapped up almost all of the outstanding design work. There were still some small kinks to work out, but two of the there pages were finalized and ready for the developers to begin coding up the designs so I could publish them.

WebAgency suggested that I overbook the schedule so that the devs never have to sit idle waiting for the next task. If I didn't give WebAgency enough to do, the hours wouldn't roll over or get credited back to me, so it was my responsibility to . I put all the design tasks into a Github project in priority order. At the end, I put in some minor bugfix tasks just so they'd have useful things to do if they finished publishing all the design work.

And then nothing happened. For two weeks, there was no activity from the devs. I asked the CEO what was going on, and he explained that they only target hours on a monthly basis. He said they'd work the remaining 48 hours, but he didn't have an exact time.

Finally, on January XXth, the devs seemed to come to life. WebAgency's project manager assigned Github issues to two of their developers, Dan and Daniel. Daniel seemed to be the more junior dev, as the PM assigned him all the small bugfix tasks while Dan was responsible for all the tasks related to implementing the designs.

Dan contacted me to talk about how I wanted him to approach the design work. We had a call where we talked things over, and he seemed to have a plan.

By the end of the work, Dan hadn't done any work, but Daniel had fixed most of the bugs from the end of the queue. In fact, 25% of my March hours went to just minor bugfixing. Oof.

There was no progress on any of the website, but one of their junior developers fixed all the bugs.

There were two big differences from how I work with developers normally, and I didn't realize initially how much of an impact they would have.

The first was that WebAgency targets hours on only a monthly basis. While TinyPilot's in-house developers each target 10-15 hours of work per week, WebAgency could not commit to any weekly goal. They only tried to make sure that they hit your hours by the end of the month. For example, in March, the first month of the retainer, WebAgency did no dev work for the first three weeks, and then they squeezed 48 billable hours into the last ten days.

The second issue is that WebAgency only showed me their billable hours twice per month: on the first and the 15th.

## The one-week task that took five weeks

The TinyPilot website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework. We were still using the same free, third-party theme I got from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) when I created the first version of the site. On top of Bootstrap and the third-party theme, we also have our own custom styles, often on a per-page or per-component basis.

The agency pointed out that this architecture was convoluted, and we should replace the third-party theme and per-page styles with our own site-wide Bootstrap theme. They estimated that it would only be a few days of work. It sounded sensible to me. It would probably pay for itself because otherwise the rest of the redesign would be fighting with three different layers of CSS styling.

The theme work ended up taking five weeks for a total cost of $6.1k.

## Before and after

TODO: Screenshots from May retro

I think the new designs are inarguably better.

Were they $46k better? It's hard to say. I certainly wouldn't have chosen to begin the project had I known the true cost and stress involved, but the site is seeing significantly more sales since we put the new design in place, so it might end up working out.

## The postmortem

The big problem seemed to be that TinyPilot is much smaller and budget-sensitive than most of their clients. He said that their typical client has a retainer in the range of $20-40k per month, so they weren't used to working within only 40 hours.

He said that in order to maximize the amount of design and engineering time I received, he minimized project management. He admitted that was a mistake, and he should have included me in that conversation to make sure it was what I wanted.

They typically work on completely new apps or bigger features where it's not valuable to deliver features piecemeal. In my case, it would have been valuable to have them work on projects serially. In other words, if the project is going to take eight months, I get more value from having the new landing page up in month three rather than waiting until month eight for everything to be done.

They minimized project management because of they were low on hours.

They actually could have shared the hours with me. They were tracking billable time with [toggl](https://toggl.com), so he wouldn't have minded just giving me access to their dashboard.

## What I'd do differently

If I were approaching this project again, here are the things I'd do differently, in descending order of importance.

### Budget more time for management

The fundamental mistake I made when hiring this agency was underestimating how much time I'd need to manage them.

The agency works with me for 40-60 hours per month. That's the same as each of TinyPilot's other freelancer developers, so I thought the agency would require similar oversight to one freelancer. I found that agencies required significantly more managment than individual freelancers for the same number of billable hours.

When you work with an agency, you're interacting with multiple people who are working on their own subprojects. More people necessarily means more management time. Agencies are supposed to abstract away the distinct people, but if you're working with different people with different specialties, you can't really have a single point of contact playing telephone for everyone.

### Narrow the project scope

If there are eight distinct tasks, they can get to 80% of them.

The biggest problem with this project has been in scoping. You might have guessed, given that I'm six months into a six-week project.

Initially, the agency and I agreed that the project was just a rebrand. We'd create a new logo, color scheme, and font for the website and then evaluate the next steps. But then came scope creep. The designers kept silently expanding the scope until I found myself halfway through [a full redesign of the website](/retrospectives/2022/01/#tinypilots-new-logo-and-learning-to-work-with-designers).

I kept feeling like if I let them go for a little longer, they'd wrap up within the month, but things kept dragging. Looking back, I should have just cut my losses and downscoped the project back to the rebranding, as we had originally planned. But I was distracted by the Voyager 2 launch, so the easiest thing for me to do was let the agency keep going.

Even though I thought I learned my lesson, scope creep bit me again this month. I created a project board with outstanding tasks for the redesign in priority order. I booked 60 agency hours for March, but I wasn't sure the design tasks would consume all the hours. I added some low-priority bugs at the end of the list in case the agency had time left over.

You know where this is going...

The design agency left all of the design tasks half-finished, but they used a quarter of my hours for the month to fix all the low-priority bugs.

Going forward, I need to set better expectations so they know not to work on non-critical tasks until all the critical tasks are complete.

### Structure for serial, incremental results

The agency worked in parallel because that's the most flexible for them. Their commitment was to deliver the finished work at the end of the project, but there were no commitments for how that work was structured. If I do this in the future, I'll push for the agency to complete tasks in serial. So if we have six tasks, I'd like to see task one and two 100% complete before we start task two. I don't want six ongoing tasks that are all going to inch closer to 100% at the same time at the end of the project.

Working in parallel seems attractive because it's the most efficient use of resources. You . But actually, it's much worse for the client in ways that are no obvious.

You're hiring a design agency because you think it will increase your profits. For the sake of simplicity, let's suppose that you have six distinct design tasks. Each task takes one month to complete, and it will increase your profits by 2%, but it will cost you $10k per month. And let's assume your profits are also $10k per month.

If the agency works on all tasks in parallel and delivers the results to you in month seven, but your profits were zero for the past six months.

If instead, the agency delivered one task per month

Letting the agency work on several things also puts you in a weak position if things go south. If there are eight distinct tasks that are partially complete, you're in the position I was where it's difficult to leave the agency because so much of the work is in jeopardy. If there are only two or three tasks in progress, you're in much better position to cut things off if they're going poorly.

Lastly, it's just more mentally taxing on you as the client to oversee eight different tasks happening in parallel. In the book _Getting Things Done_, David Allen describes unfinished tasks as "open loops." The more open loops you have, the worse your focus in general because each loop occupies a bit of real estate in your mind.

### Discuss timelines

For something like the redesign, I was expecting the dev work to take 2-3 weeks, but it actually took three months. Developers don't never like committing to precise timelines because there are so many unknowns, but for something like implementing CSS designs, it should be pretty predictable. We should have at least had a conversation about "t-shirt sizing" of work items at the granularity of weeks of work.

### Require a shared view of billable hours

At the end of March, the agency had a suggestion for the redesign: a new Bootstrap theme. The TinyPilot website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework. We're still using the same free, third-party theme I got from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) when I created the first version of the site. On top of Bootstrap and the third-party theme, we also have our own custom styles, often on a per-page or per-component basis.

The agency pointed out that this architecture was convoluted, and we should replace the third-party theme and per-page styles with our own site-wide Bootstrap theme. They estimated that it would only be a few days of work. It sounded sensible to me. It would probably pay for itself because otherwise the rest of the redesign would be fighting with three different layers of CSS styling.

The theme work ended up taking five weeks for a total cost of $6.1k. Here are the results in terms of what the user can see:

Long-term, this refactoring is helpful, but I wouldn't have chosen to do it right now. The redesign is already six months late and 5x over budget. I'd rather have a pretty website while we work on fixing ugly code than a dumpy-looking website with beautifully-factored code.

So, how did I let this happen? TinyPilot's regular devs rarely get lost in the weeds on something I didn't want, but it keeps happening with the design agency.

One critical difference is that TinyPilot's developers give me low-latency insight into how they spend their time. At the end of each working session, they record their hours with a short note saying what they were working on.

{{<img src="work-timing.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot hours reporting on Deel" hasBorder="true" caption="TinyPilot's in-house developers report their hours as they go.">}}

If I'm expecting work from them, I check their hours. If I see that they've spent 14 hours on a task that I expected to take two, it means I either underestimated the difficulty or explained the task poorly. In either case, I check in with the dev, and we decide whether to continue or course-correct.

With the design agency, there's a much slower feedback loop. They send me an update on the 15th of the month telling me only the total number of hours they've worked. At the end of the month, they send me a full report of where the hours went, but by then, it's too late.

The other issue with the design agency is that they commit to hours only on a monthly basis, not on a weekly basis. In February, they did no dev work for the first three weeks and then squeezed all of their work into the last ten days. This compounded the poor feedback loop since I couldn't distinguish between a task that was taking too long and a task that they hadn't started yet.

If I work with a design agency in the future, I'll insist on using a tool that lets us share a view of billable hours as they happen. The information is too valuable to delay for weeks, as it prevents me from identifying mismatches in expectations.

### Avoid being the smallest client

Oh, I'm getting service reserved for large clients. But I'm not getting the service for small clients. I was constantly getting deprioritized in favor of their larger clients. When I finally switched a retainer, they didn't know how to work with me at that scale.

### Start hourly, then switch to retainer

If I were to do it again, I'd buy one 30-hour block as a trial hire for the agency and then switch to a retainer agreement if the trial hire worked.

Having guaranteed hours on the agency's schedule yielded better quality. When they were squeezing my project in a few scattered hours at a time, the work was inconsistent and often felt rushed.

## What I did well

### Write a spec

I think a trap most clients fall into is that they hire an expert and then assume that the expert just knows everything. Or they wait for the expert to ask questions. If I'm hiring an expensive expert, I want to minimize the amount of time they have to spend extracting information from me. I write down everything I can think of before I even start the search process.

This has a double effect. Not only does it save billable time on the project, it also makes clients take you seriously. I've heard this again and again from people I hire, one of the reasons that they took me on as a client was that I had already put a lot of work into a project spec when I approached them. That signals to them that I'm not going to just make them play twenty questions with me to find out what I want, and I'm not just hiring them on a whim.

When WebAgency started drifting out of scope and redesigning pages outside of TinyPilot's purchase flow, the CEO was embarrassed and told me I was 100% correct because he knew I'd spelled that out in the spec.

Clients take you much more seriously if you write a spec. A lot of clients will wait for the freelancer or agency to tease information out of them.

You feel like you don't know where to begin, but you actually know a lot. Just write down what you can think of.

When they asked me what other websites I liked, I took that seriously.

### Set expectations for code review

I sent them these articles.

### Automate code review tasks

They're rotating between projects, so they're unlikely to remember your style conventions.

I had end-to-end tests set up, and they ran on every pull request to ensure that they didn't break any of the website's purchase flows. The automated checks also verified that the code adhered to our existing style conventions, didn't have stray debug logging left in.

Those tests worked. The WebAgency devs would open pull requests, and then they'd see tests break and fix it on their own. They didn't have to wait for me to give them notes. It allowed them to fix things on their own.

I realized too late that I should have automated more. While I had continuous integration in place for pull requests, I forgot to add pre-commit hooks to the repo, so there were quick tasks like style checks that could have happened instantly before they committed. I realized their developers were relying on CI to tell them about style errors rather than running the linter on their local machine. So I added a pre-commit hook and a script to enable it, similar to [what we use in the main TinyPilot repo](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/tree/2d82f7af60a1be3c99bb09cb7c2359a2abd0635e/hooks).

I had CI checks and everything, but I didn't have pre-commit checks, they were relying on CI to catch things the linter could have caught in two seconds. I didn't notice because I have the linter hooked up to my IDE.

## Why didn't you just...?

I've shared pieces of this story in my monthly retrospectives, and I've gotten some questions about why I didn't solve the problem in some easy, obvious way. Below, I've addressed why the obvious suggestions would not have worked.

As I've shared snippets of stories. I think I certainly made mistakes, but I think the people that think a project like this is trivial to manage have never managed a project like this. Or they have, and they don't realize that their code is garbage, and if they ever have to make changes, they'll have to essentially start over.

### Why didn't you just refuse to pay them until the work was done?

They required payment up-front. I had no leverage to force them to complete the project. The contract just said I was buying hours. And I paid for the hours up front, so if I refused to accept the work, they already had my money. On the monthly retainer, they required a month of notice, so I still had to pay them for a final month once I canceled.

If I had pushed for milestone-based payments from the start, they likely would have just declined the project. I think they saw me as a small client who could grow to something more substantial, but nobody wants to work with a tiny client who's going to be demanding about the budget.

### Why didn't you just find a cheap developer to do it for $4/hr?

They've either never hired anyone or they've never had to maintain code from a bargain basement developer.

### Why didn't you just fire them and hire someone better?

If you know of a place where you can reliably hire skilled web developers

It would have taken an extra 20-80 hours of my time. I have to interview candidates, ramp them up on the codebase. It was possible I'd run into the same problems or worse and then have to start over again multiple times. With WebAgency, I at least had confidence the work would get done to my standards eventually if I let them continue.

### Why didn't you just use a Shopify/WordPress/ template?

If I were starting the website over from scratch, I'd probably use a Shopify template. The site started out simple, and I was just using "buy" buttons to bring people to Shopify. Eventually
