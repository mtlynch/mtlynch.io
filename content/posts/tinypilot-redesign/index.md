Two years ago, I created a website for my business with a free theme and my terrible design skills. I told myself if the business took off, I'd hire a real designer to make it look professional.

{{<img src="landing-before-cropped.png" alt="Screenshot of old landing page" maxWidth="400px" hasBorder="true" caption="[TinyPilot website](https://tinypilotkvm.com), before design changes">}}

A year later, my business was earning $45k/month in revenue, and my website still looked like a college student's hobby project. I only wanted to redesign the three pages the customer would visit in the purchase flow for my main product, so I expected it to be a simple redesign. Maybe a few months and $10-15k.

Here's what the site looked after the redesign:

{{<img src="landing-after-cropped.png" alt="Screenshot of new landing page" maxWidth="400px" hasBorder="true" caption="[TinyPilot website](https://tinypilotkvm.com), after design changes">}}

Except it didn't take a few months and $15k. It took eight months, $46k, and a long series of headaches. Now that the project is over, I'm revisiting what mistakes I made that let this project grow so far out of control.

## I know what you're thinking

If you hear that someone spent $46k to redesign three pages of a website, you probably think they're a rube who's never hired anyone before.

But I've done this before! I've hired dozens of freelancers, including [developers](/freelancer-guidelines/), [artists](/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/), [writers](/hiring-content-writers/), and [editors](/editor/).

I definitely made mistakes on this project, but hopefully they're more interesting than the ones you expect.

## The initial estimate: four weeks and $7k

After interviewing a handful of freelancers I found through recommendations, I spoke to a US-based web design agency I found through Hacker News who I'll just call WebAgency. They gave me the highest quote, but their portfolio best matched the style I wanted, and they had a wide range of talent in-house, including design, custom illustrations, and 3D imaging.

WebAgency won my confidence when Isaac, the CEO, suggested I scope the project down to reduce costs. Isaac proposed that instead of a full-blown redesign, his agency could focus on a rebranding, so they'd create a new logo and work with me to select a new color scheme and fonts for the site.

After rebranding, I could measure results to see if it was worth continuing the redesign. If nothing else, a rebrand would give me solid foundation to create a marketing campaign with digital marketing agencies. That sounded smart!

WebAgency estimated that the rebrand would require 30-40 billable hours over two to four weeks. Their hourly rate was $175, so we were looking at $5-7k for a new logo and branding. Easy peasy.

Isaac warned that I was smaller than their other clients. Most of their customers had expensive long-term retainer agreements. This project was so tightly-scoped that we could do it hourly, but there was a possibility that they'd have to pause my work occasionally if a retainer client needed more time.

I didn't mind pausing the project for a week or two if they got busy. I was originally expecting the project to take two to three months, so an extra few weeks felt like nothing.

## The honeymoon period

The first month of the project was fantastic.

WebAgency invited me to meetings every two weeks with the CEO, their lead designer, a senior designer, and a project manager. They'd show me samples of the new logos and branding, and I'd give feedback. The next round, we'd be a little closer.

Within six weeks, we had narrowed in on a logo concept we all liked.

{{<img src="logos-6.png" hasBorder="true">}}
{{</gallery>}}

## The first red flag: scope creep

In addition to the logo, the agency was responsible for choosing new fonts and colors for the website. In our first few meetings, they showed me a few mockups of my site with different branding choices.

{{<img src="design-sketches1.png" alt="Basic designs of TinyPilot website with different colors and logos" maxWidth="800px" hasBorder="true" caption="At first, the design agency showed me how different color options would look on different basic website designs.">}}

As the project progressed, the designs became more elaborate. WebAgency started showing me custom images and icons for the site.

{{<img src="design-sketches2.png" alt="Basic designs of TinyPilot website with different colors and logos" maxWidth="800px" hasBorder="true" caption="The design agency became less interested in branding and started focusing on details of the overall website design.">}}

We'd never discussed custom illustrations, but it seemed like a small amount of work, so I just let it go.

A few weeks later, WebAgency showed me their progress, and they had made zero changes to the logo and branding. They were just showing me design ideas for the website.

"To be clear, the project is still a rebranding and not a redesign, right?," I asked.

"Oh, yes, yes!" the lead designer reassured me. "Some branding choices wouldn't make sense on top of the old design, so these are just quick sketches of how they could look."

## Just finish the logo!

By December, WebAgency was 95% done with TinyPilot's new logo. All I wanted was to change the rounding on the corners and get rid of the border. I expected it to be a couple of hours of work maximum.

I was eager to finalize the logo because it would be the first finished product from this project. Once it was done, I could use it immediately to improve the look of the website, the product's web interface, and the device's physical case.

All I needed was a couple more hours of work. But I didn't get them.

Instead, WebAgency just kept redesigning the website. Their lead designer would complete the finishing touches when he had availability, but what did I think about this new design idea for the landing page?

The breaking point came when they started showing me new designs for my site's blog. From the beginning, I had said that I only cared about three pages: the landing page, the product page, and the shopping cart page. All other pages were explicitly out of scope.

{{<img src="design-non-goals.png" alt="Non-Goals: Redesign pages outside the checkout flow. The flow I care about is landing page > product page > checkout. We don’t want to completely break pages outside that flow, but we don’t need to improve their design as part of this effort." hasBorder="true" caption="Excerpt from [project specification](tinypilot-redesign-spec.pdf) listing the blog as explicitly out of scope.">}}

I emailed Isaac, and he called me, embarrassed. He admitted that the designers went beyond just sketching. They were just so excited about the project that they got carried away and designed more than they should have, but he was going to remove the hours they'd spent redesigning the blog.

## The two-month holiday slowdown

Midway through December, I noticed WebAgency had stopped making progress on anything.

They stopped scheduling calls to review work with me. They occasionally shared updates over email, but comments I left on their designs sat ignored for weeks.

At the time, I chalked it up to the holidays. Lots of people are on vacation in December, so I assumed things would pick back up in the new year.

The new year started, and not only did the pace stay slow, the quality of the work degraded. We had an easy, clear communication at the start of the project, but now a minor note about background color would require three back-and-forths.

## "I just don't know when we'll have the hours"

In early February, I emailed Isaac to ask what was going on. We had a call, and he apologized for the way the project was going. He admitted that things were bumpy internally at WebAgency. Their project manager quit in November, and Isaac was scrambling to fill the role himself while also interviewing replacements.

He confirmed that I wasn't imagining the drop in quality. WebAgency was overloaded with work from their larger clients. They were squeezing my project into the gaps, so their designers probably weren't as focused as when we started.

I said I understood I was a small client to them, and I was willing to wait a few weeks until their other work slowed down. I just wanted the remaining 10-20 hours of work to be high-quality October hours and not the harried, pop-in-whenever hours I saw in December and January.

"We'll definitely finish your project. I just don't know when we'll have the hours," Isaac told me. I asked if they'd have time within the next two months. He wasn't sure.

Isaac did, however, have an idea for how we could complete the project quickly.

## The solution is to pay more

The real issue, Isaac said, was that I was their only hourly client. I would always be at the mercy of their long-term retainer clients pre-empting my project. So what if I signed a retainer agreement to protect my hours each month? Their retainers started at 40 hours per month for $160/hr.

I felt duped and manipulated. They structured the work so that everything was 80-90% done, but nothing was usable. If I took the work to a new vendor, there'd be a huge amount of rework. And now they were holding the last 20% hostage until I signed an expensive retainer agreement with them?

As diplomatically as possible, I told Isaac that I felt like the situation was WebAgency's fault. If a retainer agreement was better for everyone, why didn't they propose it months ago? The project could have been done by now.

Isaac conceded that the situation was unfair to me. He promised to retroactively adjust my December and January bills as if I'd been on a retainer agreement and refund the difference. The offer was not even contingent on the new retainer.

But what would we do with 40 hours per month if there were only 20 hours left in the project? Isaac proposed that WebAgency take over the design portion of the project that I had planned for TinyPilot's in-house developers to do. WebAgency billed a much higher rate than TinyPilot's developers, but Isaac predicted they'd reduce costs overall. TinyPilot's devs specialize in Python and JavaScript, but WebAgency's devs do design-heavy work all the time. Plus, they already work closely with the designers.

I signed the retainer. My 60 high-quality retainer hours were scheduled to resume in March.

## Development begins with... minor bugfixes?

The retainer agreement started off well. Within the first week, WebAgency wrapped up almost all of the outstanding design work. There were still some small kinks to work out, but two of the three pages were ready to hand over to the developers.

But then nothing happened. For two weeks, there was no activity from the dev team. I asked Isaac what was going on, and he explained that WebAgency's schedule is fluid, so they won't necessarily work on my project every week. He assured me that by the end of the month, they'd certainly use the remaining 48 hours I'd booked.

When the month ended, WebAgency hadn't moved the website any closer to the new design. Instead, in the last few days of the month, they fixed a bunch of minor bugs from my issue tracker.

{{<img src="console-log.png" alt="Screenshot of new landing page" hasBorder="true" caption="One of the WebAgency developers used 15 of the month's 60 hours to fix the minor bugs from the end of the task queue.">}}

WebAgency had asked me to create a list of development tasks I wanted them to complete, and those bugs were there, but at the end of the list. WebAgency encouraged me to overbook the schedule so that the devs never have to sit idle waiting for the next task, as they didn't refund unused hours.

What I didn't anticipate was that two of WebAgency's developers would split the tasks, and the junior dev would spend a quarter of the month's billable hours chipping away at low-priority bugs from the end of the project list.

## The one-week task that took five weeks

In April, there was a new problem.

The TinyPilot website uses the [Bootstrap CSS framework](https://getbootstrap.com/), and it still had the same Bootstrap theme I used when I first launched the website.

WebAgency pointed out that it would be convoluted to layer a new design on top of a totally different theme. They proposed replacing the theme and all of our custom CSS with a custom TinyPilot Bootstrap theme. Their dev estimated that he'd only need a few days to complete the switch, and it would make the rest of the project go much faster.

Days stretched into weeks, and I still didn't have the new theme. Was the work taking longer than they expected? Or was this just a repeat of last month where most of the dev hours would be squeezed into the last few days of the month? At the end of the month, the invoice gave me my answer.

The "one-week" task of replacing the Bootstrap theme ultimately took five weeks and 38 billable hours for a total cost of $6.1k.

## The final month

By May, we were seven months and $46k into what was supposed to be a four-week, $7k rebranding. Every month, it seemed like we were weeks away from the finish line, but something always popped up to prevent WebAgency from finishing anything I cared about.

I gave WebAgency the required 28 days' notice to terminate the contract. Because I paid for each month up front, I worried WebAgency would have no incentive to put in quality work for the final month.

Surprisingly, the dev work was never smoother than after I canceled the contract. The project finally seemed to work at the pace I expected. They coded up each page within 7-10 days.

There were still some issues, but I was prepared for them. WebAgency kept suggesting new flourishes to the design I declined all of them, and I'm glad I did because they barely had enough time to wrap up the basics.

They actually didn't even have enough time for the basics. The month ended with the final page incomplete and no communication about how WebAgency would disengage from the project. But on June 1st, they told me that they'd finish the outstanding work at no charge, and they officially finished two days later.

And then it was finally done! This project had spiralled so far beyond what I initially wanted, so I was incredibly relieved to put it behind me.

## Before and after

Here's what the site looked like after the redesign:

## The postmortem

After the project ended, I asked Isaac if he'd be open to a postmortem to discuss what could be improved on the project. I said I had some ideas for improvement on both sides, and I was interested in hearing his perspective as well. He was candid with me in admitting that the project hadn't gone as smoothly as he'd hoped, and he was open to talking it through with me.

Isaac felt that the underlying problem was that WebAgency had trouble scaling down their workflows to fit TinyPilot's budget. Their typical client has a retainer in the range of $20-40k per month. TinyPilot was buying only 40-60 hours per month, which they typically only reserve for maintenance rather than new development.

I told him that I wished we'd structed the work to give me incremental results so that I'd have the logo first, then the landing page design, then the product page design, etc. instead of working on everything in parallel. He said that WebAgency typically works on completely new apps or bigger features where it's not valuable to deliver features piecemeal, so they weren't used to working that way, though he understood why I would have preferred it.

I expected WebAgency to be more active in managing the project, but it ultimately felt like they had just loaned me developers and left me to do project management myself. Isaac agreed that this was true and that this was a misstep on his part. He said that WebAgency tries to keep project management to less than 5% of billable hours, but on a 40-hour retainer, that meant eliminating the project managers entirely. He admitted that he should have included me in that conversation to make sure it was what I wanted.

I mentioned how I wished I could have had more insight into their hours as they happened. I felt silly because Isaac said WebAgency would have been happy to share that with me had I asked. They were tracking billable time with [toggl](https://toggl.com), so he wouldn't have minded just giving me access to their dashboard.

## What I'd do differently

If I were approaching this project again, here are the things I'd do differently, in descending order of importance.

### Hire an individaul freelancer instead of an agency

TODO

I don't want to overgeneralize agencies based on this one experience, but I think

### Budget more time for management

The fundamental mistake I made when hiring this agency was underestimating how much time I'd need to manage them. I certainly made other mistakes, but I think those would have been less likely had I kept a closer eye on the project to make sure that things were on track.

The agency was working with me for 40-60 hours per month, which was the same as each of TinyPilot's other freelancer developers. I thought the agency would require similar oversight to one freelancer, but having more people on a project requires more management even if they're collectively only working 40 hours per month.

### Structure for serial, incremental results

At first, letting the agency parallelize their work seems like the obvious choice &mdash; It shortens the project's total duration, and it lets the agency use their resources more efficiently. But for a small, budget-conscious client there are subtle but significant drawbacks.

Put another way, if a project involves eight tasks that will take roughly one month each, would you rather have the agency complete one task per month? Or would you rather they work on all eight tasks simultaneously and deliver them all at the end of eight months?

The one-at-a-time is better value for your money. At the end of month one, you have one asset that provides value to your business for the next seven months. In month two, you have even more, and so on.

Allowing the agency to parallelize maximally also puts you in terrible negotiating position. If the agency has eight tasks that are all 80% complete, it's expensive for you to scope down the project or switch vendors. If you limit the agency to only two or three tasks at a time, there's much less friction if you have to hand the work to someone else.

Lastly, it's just more mentally taxing to oversee eight subprojects in parallel because every unfinished task occupies a bit of real estate in your mind. It's better to knock them out in small batches as opposed to dragging everything out for the full length of the project.

### Narrow the project scope

At the design stage, I let the agency go too far in redesigning the website when they were supposed to focus on just the logo, color scheme, and fonts.

During the implementation phase, I should have been more aggressive in preventing them from working on minor bugfixes until they finished publishing the new designs.

### Agree on timelines

At the start of the project, I asked how long the agency expected it to take. They said it was up to me. I might love their first pitch, or I could reject everything for weeks. That was sensible, so I didn't push for a more exact timeline.

I mistakenly let my loose attitude on design timelines carry over into the development work. I should have pressed the developers to share rough estimates of each task with the understanding that we'd revisit scope if a task ballooned far beyond our expectations.

### Require a shared view of billable hours

Many of the issues with scope bloat were a consequence of the slow feedback loop in WebAgency's hours reporting.

Halfway through each month, WebAgency reported an opaque total number of hours used. At the end of the month, they'd send a per-task breakdown. By then, it was too late to catch tasks that had bloated beyond their initial scope.

{{<img src="hours-summary.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot hours reporting on Deel" maxWidth="550px" hasBorder="true" caption="WebAgency only reported cost of each task in an invoice at the end of the month.">}}

In contrast, TinyPilot's in-house developers report their hours at the end of each working session. If a three-hour task explodes into something bigger, we re-evaluate whether to cut or downscope the task.

{{<img src="work-timing.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot hours reporting on Deel" hasBorder="true" caption="TinyPilot's in-house developers report their hours as they go.">}}

If I work with a design agency in the future, I'll insist on using a tool that lets us share a view of billable hours as they happen, similar to what I use with TinyPilot's regular devs.

### Avoid hiring a vendor as their smallest client

When we started the project, WebAgency told me that most of their clients were larger than I was, but they wanted to help me grow. It sounded like a great deal. I thought I'd get service normally reserved for large clients despite my limited budget.

TODO: Screen cap of _Mad Men_ scene

In reality, I didn't get the same service as their large clients. When I was an hourly client, WebAgency was deprioritizing me in favor of their larger clients. When I switched to a retainer, they didn't know how to work with me on the scale of 40-60 hours per month.

## Why didn't you just...?

I've shared pieces of this story in my [monthly retrospectives](/retrospectives), and I've gotten some questions about why I didn't solve the problem in some easy, obvious way. I think this feedback is well-intentioned, but a lot of it comes from people who have no real-world experience working with agencies or freelancers.

Below, I've addressed why some of the obvious suggestions I've received would not have worked.

### Why didn't you just refuse to pay them until the work was done?

WebAgency required payment up-front. For the hourly contract, I had to buy 30-hour blocks up front. For the monthly retainer, I had to pay for the full month's bill before work began. There was no financial leverage to force them to complete the project.

If I had insisted on milestone-based payments from the beginning, WebAgency likely would have simply declined the project. They saw me as a small client who could grow, but nobody wants to work with a tiny client who thinks they can behave like a huge corporation.

### Why didn't you just find a cheap developer to do it for $4/hr?

In my experience, cheap developers are worthwhile if the following conditions are true:

1. You need throwaway code that has to work exactly once
1. You value your time at zero, so you don't mind giving two hours of feedback for every hour of work you receive from the freelancer

I plan to keep the TinyPilot website around for a while, so I want code that I understand and feel comfortable maintaining. For that, I need a competent developer who can write clear code.

### Why didn't you just fire them and hire someone better?

Firing WebAgency and searching for a replacement would have burned 30-60 hours of management time. And there was no guarantee that I'd find someone better.

For most of the project, I was sitting on a bunch of partially-complete tasks. The cost of reassigning half-done work and spinning up a new vendor would be almost as expensive as starting over from scratch.

### Why didn't you just use a Shopify template?

If I could go back to when I first created the website, I would have made it a simple Shopify store with a custom theme.

When I launched the site, I didn't want to marry myself to Shopify and learn their templating system when all I needed was a simple "buy" button, so I just hand-coded the site using a frontend framework I knew well.

Over time, TinyPilot's purchase experience became more complex. I ended up expensively reimplementing functionality that would have been free had I used a Shopify store. But at this point, migrating all the site's content to a Shopify store would be its own major project, so I stuck with redesigning what I had.

## Conclusion

I think that WebAgency did their best on this project. I don't feel like they tried to deceive me or squeeze money out of me. We just didn't match. I was used to working with individual freelancers, and they were accustomed to larger clients.

If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't. But despite all the missteps and stress, this project might end up working out overall. I expected the new website to increase sales by 10-20%, but it's been closer to 40%. In July, the TinyPilot had its all-time high of $72.5k in sales, which was $28.7k or 66% higher than the month before we launched the new designs.

It's too early to tell, but I'm optimistic about earning a positive return on the $46k I paid WebAgency.
