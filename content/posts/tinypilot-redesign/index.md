title: "Things I Wish I'd Known Before Spending $46k on a Website Redesign"

In 2020, I put up a website for a produce I was launching called TinyPilot. I had no idea if the business would go anywhere, so the first version of the website was just a basic site with a free theme. A year later, my business was earning $45k/month in revenue, and my website still looked like a college student's hobby project, so it was time for a touch-up.

I set aside $15k for a redesign, which I expected to take two or three months.

Here's what the site looked after the redesign:

{{<img src="landing-after-cropped.png" alt="Screenshot of new landing page" maxWidth="332px" hasBorder="true">}}
{{</gallery>}}

Except it didn't take three months and $15k. It took eight months, $46k, and a massive amount of headache.

Now that the project is over, I'm revisiting what happened and what mistakes I made in hiring and working with the web design agency that did this work.

## I know what you're thinking

If you hear that someone spent $46k to redesign three pages of a website, you probably think they're a clueless rube who's never hired anyone before.

I've never hired an agency, but I've hired dozens of freelancers, including [developers](/freelancer-guidelines/), [artists](/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/), [writers](/hiring-content-writers/), and [editors](/editor/). I'm also a software developer, so I understood the work I hired the agency to complete.

I definitely made mistakes on this project, but hopefully they're more interesting than the ones you might guess.

## Finding a design agency

The problem with being a bootstrapped founder is that if you can find them by Googling "web design agency," they're about 10x too expensive for you. So it's hard to find people that match your size. I asked for recommendations and searched on sites like Indie Hackers and Hacker News.

I interviewed four freelancers and one agency, who I'll just call WebAgency.

WebAgency immediately stood out as the best. Their portfolio showed a variety of styles that they executed well, and they had lots of different expertise in-house, so they could do design, development, animations, and 3D images if I needed them.

What's more, WebAgency's CEO suggested I reduce the project scope. He said that instead of a full-blown redesign, I should just start with a rebranding. WebAgency would create a new logo and work with me to select a new color scheme and fonts for the site. From there, I could measure results, and the branding would let me start working with digital marketing agencies. That sounded smart!

## The initial estimate: four weeks and $7k

WebAgency estimated that the rebrand would require 30-40 billable hours over two to four weeks at their hourly rate $175/hour. So, $5-7k for new logo and branding felt reasonable to me.

WebAgency's CEO warned me that I was smaller than most of their other clients. Most of their clients have them on long-term retainer agreements. This project was so tightly-scoped that we could do it hourly, but there was a possibility that they'd have to pause my work occasionally if a retainer client needed more time.

I didn't mind pausing the project for a week or two if they got busy. I was originally expecting the project to take two or three months, so stretching out a 4-week project was still well within my timeline.

## The honeymoon period

The first month of the project was fantastic.

WebAgency's CEO was on all the calls, as well as the company's lead designer, a senior designer, and a project manager. They'd show me samples of the new logos and branding. I told them what I liked and disliked about the options. They took my feedback graciously, and the next round, we'd be a little closer.

Within six weeks, we had narrowed in on a logo concept we all liked:

{{<gallery caption="From oldest to newest, the progression of TinyPilot logo drafts that WebAgency showed me in the first few weeks of the project.">}}
{{<img src="logos-1.png" hasBorder="true">}}
{{<img src="logos-2.png" hasBorder="true">}}
{{<img src="logos-5.png" hasBorder="true">}}
{{<img src="logos-6.png" hasBorder="true">}}
{{</gallery>}}

## The first red flag: scope creep

In addition to the logo, the agency was also responsible for choosing new fonts and colors for the website. They showed me mockups of different colors and how they'd look with my site design and the new logo.

TODO: Show draft

At first, their mockups were just my site with different colors and fonts. As we continued to meet, the designs got more elaborate.

TODO: Show draft

Finally, they held a meeting just to show me different design ideas for the website. "To be clear, this project is still just the rebranding, right?," I asked them.

"Oh, yes, yes!" the lead designer reassured me. "Some branding choices wouldn't make sense on top of the old design, so these are just quick sketches of how they could look."

## Just finish the logo!

They were 95% done with the logo, but I'd asked for a few final adjustments. I was desperate to get the logo to 100% because once that was done, I could put it on the sales site, my product's web app, and on the physical device's case. But instead of finalizing the last 5% of the logo, they just kept redesigning the website.

The breaking point was when they started showing me new designs for my site's blog. From the beginning, I had said that I only cared about the purchase flow, and all other pages were explicitly out of scope.

I emailed the CEO, and he called me. He was embarrassed that the designers had gotten off track. He admitted that the designers went beyond just sketching. He said they were just so excited about the project that they got carried away and designed more than they should have, but he was going to remove the hours for the out of scope work.

I didn't like that they had gone beyond the scope of the rebrand, but I reasoned that they were doing quality work, and I'd probably work with them in the future anyway, so why not do it.

## The two-month holiday slowdown

Starting in December, WebAgency's work slowed down. A lot.

They stopped scheduling calls to review work with me. They occasionally shared updates over email, but comments I left on their designs sat ignored for weeks.

At the time, I chalked it up to the holidays. Lots of people are on vacation in December, so I assumed things would pick back up in the new year.

The slow pace continued into January. And not only was the pace slow, the quality of the work degraded.

When the project started, we communicated effectively. I'd give them feedback on the designs, and they'd integrate my feedback. But now, when I'd say something like, "there's not enough contrast between the text input and the background," it took three back-and-forths before they understood what I was saying.

## "I don't know when we'll have the hours to finish"

I emailed the CEO to ask what was going on. We had a call, and he apologized for the way the project was going. He admitted that things were bumpy internally at WebAgency. Their project manager quit in November, and the CEO was scrambling to cover those duties while also interviewing replacements.

He confirmed that I wasn't imagining the drop in quality. They were busy with their larger clients, so they were squeezing my project into the gaps, but the designers probably aren't as focused as they were when we started.

I said I understood I was a small client to them. I was willing to wait a few weeks until their other work slowed down. We both agreed that there were probably only 10-15 hours of design work left. I just wanted them to be high-quality October hours and not the harried, squeeze-in-whatever time I saw in December and January.

"We'll definitely finish your project. I just don't know when we'll have the hours," the CEO told me. I asked if it would be done by March, and he said he wasn't sure.

WebAgency's CEO did, however, have an idea for how we could complete the project quickly.

## The solution is to pay more

The real issue, WebAgency's CEO, said was that I was their only hourly client. I would always be at risk of their long-term retainer clients pre-empting my project. So what if I signed a retainer agreement to hire them long-term?

My initial reaction was outrage. The solution to them doing a poor job was that I have to make an even bigger commitment to them and give them even more money? And if a retainer was better for everyone, why didn't they just ask me to switch back in November? If my project went off the rails because of problems at WebAgency, why was I absorbing the cost?

The CEO agreed that it was unfair. He told me he'd retroactively adjust my December and January bills as if I'd been on a retainer agreement and refund the difference. And he said the offer stood even if I walked away at that point.

The CEO emphasized that the retainer would allow WebAgency to handle not only the design work but the development work to get it on my site. I had planned to use TinyPilot's in-house developers for that, but it was going poorly. TinyPilot's developers worked primarily in JavaScript and Python, so implementing designs in CSS wasn't their strong suit. WebAgency's CEO estimated that even their developers were significantly more expensive than TinyPilot's, the project would cost less overall since WebAgency's developers have so much experienced working with their designers and implementing their designs.

## Start over or push through?

WebAgency put me in a tough position. Should I dig myself even deeper into the project by signing the retainer agreement? Do I wait around for months until they find time for me on an hourly contract? Or do I hire someone else to finish the work?

All the designs were around 80% done, but nothing was usable. The logo still needed those final few adjustments. They had mostly completed the page designs for desktop, but they hadn't started the mobile versions. That meant I couldn't hand any work off to TinyPilot's developers because they needed both desktop and mobile designs to begin work. I was four months and $XXk into what was supposed to be a six-week project.

I had seen WebAgency do excellent work, but I'd also seen them drop the ball. Would the retainer get me back to the excellent work? It sounded plausible.

Switching designers would have been incredibly difficult. I've seen what happens when one person tries to finish a project that someone else claimed was 80% done. The results are never good.

I was in the middle of launching a new product, and I barely had time to do my current work. I didn't have time to search, interview, and onboard a new agency or freelancer.

I signed the retainer. My good, protected hours were scheduled to resume in March.

## Life as a retainer client

We were off to a good start. Within the first week of my retainer month, they wrapped up almost all of the outstanding design work. There were still some small kinks to work out, but two of the there pages were finalized and ready for the developers to begin coding up the designs so I could publish them.

WebAgency suggested that I overbook the schedule so that the devs never have to sit idle waiting for the next task. If I didn't give WebAgency enough to do, the hours wouldn't roll over or get credited back to me, so it was my responsibility to . I put all the design tasks into a Github project in priority order. At the end, I put in some minor bugfix tasks just so they'd have useful things to do if they finished publishing all the design work.

And then nothing happened. For two weeks, there was no activity from the devs. I asked the CEO what was going on, and he explained that they only target hours on a monthly basis. He said they'd work the remaining 48 hours, but he didn't have an exact time.

Finally, on January XXth, the devs seemed to come to life. WebAgency's project manager assigned Github issues to two of their developers, Dan and Daniel. Daniel seemed to be the more junior dev, as the PM assigned him all the small bugfix tasks while Dan was responsible for all the tasks related to implementing the designs.

Dan contacted me to talk about how I wanted him to approach the design work. We had a call where we talked things over, and he seemed to have a plan.

By the end of the work, Dan hadn't submitted any work to make progress on publishing the new designs. Meanwhile, Daniel used 15 of the 60 hours I'd booked to fix the minor bugs from the end of the task queue. Oof.

## The one-week task that took five weeks

The TinyPilot website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework. We were still using the same free, third-party theme I got from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) when I created the first version of the site. On top of Bootstrap and the third-party theme, we also have our own custom styles, often on a per-page or per-component basis.

Dan pointed out that this architecture was convoluted, and we should replace the third-party theme and per-page styles with our own site-wide Bootstrap theme. Dan estimated that it would only be a few days of work.

It sounded sensible to me. It would probably pay for itself because otherwise the rest of the redesign would be fighting with three different layers of CSS styling.

A few days later, Dan said there was another issue. I wasn't using CSS utility classes. Like a caveman, I was still assigning my own CSS classes to page elements and then defining style rules like `margin: 1rem`. What I should be doing instead, Dan said, was to use Bootstrap's

Weeks went by and they kept working on refactoring the theme. Because WebAgency didn't report their hours until the end of the month, I couldn't tell if we'd burned two hours on this work or 30.

At the end of the month, the final hours breakdown gave me my answer. The "one-week task" of replacing the Bootstrap theme ultimately took five weeks for a total cost of $6.1k.

## The final month

By May, we were seven months in, and I'd spent $46k on what was supposed to be a simple rebranding.

Every month, it seemed like we were weeks away from wrapping up the project. And every month, something managed to eat up time and prevent WebAgency from finishing the thing I cared about.

I decided I had to cut things off or this project could drag out for years. I gave WebAgency the required 28 days' notice that I was terminating the retainer contract.

Surprisingly, May was the month where the project progressed at the pace I expected from the start. Dan was able to code up each page within 7-10 days. WebAgency kept suggesting new flourishes to the design, and I always declined and asked them to focus on just wrapping up the basics in the time we had remaining.

By the final week, they had completed two of the three pages. The only thing left wast the product detail page, which was also the most complex.

TODO: Photo of product detail page

With two days left in May, Dan created a pull request that implemented the design changes to the product page. Yes! Victory was close at hand!

I looked closer at the code and saw that it was a bit of a mess. It mixed refactoring changes with behavioral changes (TODO: link), style changes with functional changes, and it had a functional bug that prevented the user from adding and removing items from their shopping cart. The pull request was still in draft state, so I was hoping Dan viewed this code as a rough draft.

On the last day of the month, I was anxiously watching Dan's final pull request to see what would happen. Would WebAgency disappear and leave me with a broken, incomplete code change? Or would they tell me I have to pay them more to finish it up?

Surprisingly, nothing happened. The month ended without any communication from WebAgency about how they'd disengage from the project.

Then, on June 1st, I received an email from Dan. He told me that WebAgency's CEO authorized him to wrap up the last pull request at no charge. I pointed out the bug and asked them to split it into five distinct pull requests. To their credit, they did with no fuss. They wrapped up the outstanding work in two days.

And then it was finally done! I was incredibly relieved not to be dealing with this project anymore that had spiralled so far beyond what I initially wanted.

## Before and after

Here's what the site looked like after the redesign:

{{<img src="landing-after.png" alt="Screenshot of new landing page" maxWidth="260px" hasBorder="true">}}

{{<img src="cart-after.png" alt="Screenshot of new shopping cart page" maxWidth="340px" hasBorder="true">}}
{{</gallery>}}

The new designs are inarguably better. Were they _$46k better_? It's hard to say.

I certainly wouldn't have chosen to begin the project had I known the true cost and stress involved, but the site is seeing significantly more sales since we put the new design in place, so it might end up working out.

## The postmortem

After the project ended, I asked WebAgency's CEO if he'd be open to a postmortem to discuss what could be improved on the project. I said I had some ideas for improvement on both sides, and I was interested in hearing his perspective as well. He was candid with me in admitting that the project hadn't gone as smoothly as he'd hoped, and he was open to talking it through with me.

He felt that the underlying problem was that WebAgency had trouble scaling down their workflows to fit TinyPilot's budget. Their typical client has a retainer in the range of $20-40k per month. TinyPilot was buying only 40-60 hours per month, which they typically only reserve for maintenance rather than new development.

I told him that I wished we'd structed the work to give me incremental results so that I'd have the logo first, then the landing page design, then the product page design, etc. instead of working on everything in parallel. He said that WebAgency typically works on completely new apps or bigger features where it's not valuable to deliver features piecemeal, so they weren't used to working that way, though he understood why I would have preferred it.

I told WebAgency that I expected that one of the benefits of the agency was that they'd be more active in managing the project, but it ultimately felt like I was doing my own project management and they had just loaned me developers. He agreed that this was true and that this was a misstep on his part. He said that WebAgency tries to keep project management to less than 5% of billable hours, but on a 40-hour retainer, that meant basically eliminating the project managers from the project. He admitted that was a mistake, and he should have included me in that conversation to make sure it was what I wanted.

I mentioned how I wished I could have had more insight into their hours as they happened, and I felt silly because he said they would have been happy to share that with me had I asked. They were tracking billable time with [toggl](https://toggl.com), so he wouldn't have minded just giving me access to their dashboard.

## What I'd do differently

If I were approaching this project again, here are the things I'd do differently, in descending order of importance.

### Budget more time for management

The fundamental mistake I made when hiring this agency was underestimating how much time I'd need to manage them. I certainly made other mistakes, but I think those would have been less likely had I kept a closer eye on the project to make sure that things were on track.

The agency was working with me for 40-60 hours per month, which was the same as each of TinyPilot's other freelancer developers. I thought the agency would require similar oversight to one freelancer, but having more people on a project requires more management even if they're collectively only working 40 hours per month.

### Narrow the project scope

If there are eight distinct tasks, they can get to 80% of them.

Initially, the agency and I agreed that the project was just a rebrand. We'd create a new logo, color scheme, and font for the website and then evaluate the next steps. But then came scope creep. The designers kept silently expanding the scope until I found myself halfway through [a full redesign of the website](/retrospectives/2022/01/#tinypilots-new-logo-and-learning-to-work-with-designers).

I kept feeling like if I let them go for a little longer, they'd wrap up within the month, but things kept dragging. Looking back, I should have just cut my losses and downscoped the project back to the rebranding, as we had originally planned. But I was distracted by the Voyager 2 launch, so the easiest thing for me to do was let the agency keep going.

Even though I thought I learned my lesson, scope creep bit me again this month. I created a project board with outstanding tasks for the redesign in priority order. I booked 60 agency hours for March, but I wasn't sure the design tasks would consume all the hours. I added some low-priority bugs at the end of the list in case the agency had time left over.

You know where this is going...

The design agency left all of the design tasks half-finished, but they used a quarter of my hours for the month to fix all the low-priority bugs.

Going forward, I need to set better expectations so they know not to work on non-critical tasks until all the critical tasks are complete.

### Structure for serial, incremental results

The agency worked in parallel because that's the most flexible for them. Their commitment was to deliver the finished work at the end of the project, but there were no commitments for how that work was structured. If I do this in the future, I'll push for the agency to complete tasks in serial. So if we have six tasks, I'd like to see task one and two 100% complete before we start task two. I don't want six ongoing tasks that are all going to inch closer to 100% at the same time at the end of the project.

Working in parallel seems attractive because it's the most efficient use of resources. You . But actually, it's much worse for the client in ways that are no obvious.

You're hiring a design agency because you think it will increase your profits. For the sake of simplicity, let's suppose that you have six distinct design tasks. Each task takes one month to complete, and it will increase your profits by 2%, but it will cost you $10k per month. And let's assume your profits are also $10k per month.

If the agency works on all tasks in parallel and delivers the results to you in month seven, but your profits were zero for the past six months.

If instead, the agency delivered one task per month

Letting the agency work on several things also puts you in a weak position if things go south. If there are eight distinct tasks that are partially complete, you're in the position I was where it's difficult to leave the agency because so much of the work is in jeopardy. If there are only two or three tasks in progress, you're in much better position to cut things off if they're going poorly.

Lastly, it's just more mentally taxing on you as the client to oversee eight different tasks happening in parallel. In the book _Getting Things Done_, David Allen describes unfinished tasks as "open loops." The more open loops you have, the worse your focus in general because each loop occupies a bit of real estate in your mind.

### Discuss timelines

For something like the redesign, I was expecting the dev work to take 2-3 weeks, but it actually took three months. Developers don't never like committing to precise timelines because there are so many unknowns, but for something like implementing CSS designs, it should be pretty predictable. We should have at least had a conversation about "t-shirt sizing" of work items at the granularity of weeks of work.

### Require a shared view of billable hours

Remember the Bootstrap refactoring that was supposed to take a few days but stretched into five weeks? I tried to figure out how that happened with the agency when that never happens with TinyPilot's in-house developers.

One critical difference is that TinyPilot's developers give me low-latency insight into how they spend their time. At the end of each working session, they record their hours with a short note saying what they were working on.

{{<img src="work-timing.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot hours reporting on Deel" hasBorder="true" caption="TinyPilot's in-house developers report their hours as they go.">}}

If I'm expecting work from them, I check their hours. If I see that they've spent 14 hours on a task that I expected to take two, it means I either underestimated the difficulty or explained the task poorly. In either case, I check in with the dev, and we decide whether to continue or course-correct.

WebAgency had a slower feedback loop. They send me an update on the 15th of the month telling me only the total number of hours they've worked. At the end of the month, they send me a full report of where the hours went, but by then, it's too late. And because they don't work consistent hours each week, I can't tell the difference between a week where they're working fewer hours and a week where a task is stretching longer than we expected.

If I work with a design agency in the future, I'll insist on using a tool that lets us share a view of billable hours as they happen. I don't need some creepy spyware that monitors keystrokes, just something that lets them self-report what they did in each billable working session.

### Avoid hiring an agency as their smallest client

When we started the project, they told me that most of their clients were larger than I was, but they wanted to help me grow. It sounded like a great deal that I'd get service normally reserved for large clients

In reality, I didn't get the same service as their large clients. When I was an hourly client, WebAgency was deprioritizing me in favor of their larger clients. When I switched to a retainer, they didn't know how to work with me on the scale of 40-60 hours per month.

## What I did well

### Write a spec

I think a trap most clients fall into is that they hire an expert and then assume that the expert just knows everything. Or they wait for the expert to ask questions. If I'm hiring an expensive expert, I want to minimize the amount of time they have to spend extracting information from me. I write down everything I can think of before I even start the search process.

This has a double effect. Not only does it save billable time on the project, it also makes clients take you seriously. I've heard this again and again from people I hire, one of the reasons that they took me on as a client was that I had already put a lot of work into a project spec when I approached them. That signals to them that I'm not going to just make them play twenty questions with me to find out what I want, and I'm not just hiring them on a whim.

When WebAgency started drifting out of scope and redesigning pages outside of TinyPilot's purchase flow, the CEO was embarrassed and told me I was 100% correct because he knew I'd spelled that out in the spec.

Clients take you much more seriously if you write a spec. A lot of clients will wait for the freelancer or agency to tease information out of them.

You feel like you don't know where to begin, but you actually know a lot. Just write down what you can think of.

When they asked me what other websites I liked, I took that seriously.

### Set expectations for code review

I sent them these articles.

### Automate code review tasks

They're rotating between projects, so they're unlikely to remember your style conventions.

I had end-to-end tests set up, and they ran on every pull request to ensure that they didn't break any of the website's purchase flows. The automated checks also verified that the code adhered to our existing style conventions, didn't have stray debug logging left in.

Those tests worked. The WebAgency devs would open pull requests, and then they'd see tests break and fix it on their own. They didn't have to wait for me to give them notes. It allowed them to fix things on their own.

I realized too late that I should have automated more. While I had continuous integration in place for pull requests, I forgot to add pre-commit hooks to the repo, so there were quick tasks like style checks that could have happened instantly before they committed. I realized their developers were relying on CI to tell them about style errors rather than running the linter on their local machine. So I added a pre-commit hook and a script to enable it, similar to [what we use in the main TinyPilot repo](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/tree/2d82f7af60a1be3c99bb09cb7c2359a2abd0635e/hooks).

I had CI checks and everything, but I didn't have pre-commit checks, they were relying on CI to catch things the linter could have caught in two seconds. I didn't notice because I have the linter hooked up to my IDE.

## Why didn't you just...?

I've shared pieces of this story in my monthly retrospectives, and I've gotten some questions about why I didn't solve the problem in some easy, obvious way. I think this feedback is well-intentioned, but a lot of it comes from people who have never hired anyone, much less an agency. Below, I've addressed why the obvious suggestions would not have worked.

### Why didn't you just refuse to pay them until the work was done?

WebAgency required payment up-front, so I had no leverage to force them to complete the project.

If I had pushed for milestone-based payments at the start of the contract, WebAgency likely would have just declined the project. They saw me as a small client who could grow to something more substantial, but nobody wants to work with a tiny client who makes demands like a giant corporation.

### Why didn't you just find a cheap developer to do it for $4/hr?

In my experience, cheap developers are worthwhile in two scenarios:

1. You need throwaway code that has to work once and never require any changes
1. You value your time at zero, so you don't mind giving 20 hours of feedback on a task a competent developer could complete in three hours

I plan to keep the TinyPilot website around for a while, so I want code that I understand and feel comfortable maintaining. That meant I needed a developer who can write clear, maintainable code.

### Why didn't you just fire them and hire someone better?

I did consider firing WebAgency at several points, especially as the proejct shifted from design to development.

It took me 20-30 hours of searching and interviewing to find WebAgency, and I was dreading starting that process over. Especially because the end always seemed like it was weeks away.

The other problem is that handing off a project midway through causes substantial rework. If I switch vendors 200 hours into a 300-hour project, it's probably going to take the next vendor 150-200 hours to finish, as they have to re-do all the onboarding to understand the project and then figure out how to take over where the first agency left off.

### Why didn't you just use a Shopify template?

If I could go back in time to when I first created the website, I would have made it a simple Shopify store with a custom theme.

When I launched the site, I used Vue, as it was the tech stack I knew best for web development. I didn't want to marry myself to Shopify and learn their templating system when all I needed was a simple "buy" button.

Over time, TinyPilot's purchase experience became more complex, and I expensively reimplemented functionality that would have been free had I used a Shopify store. But at this point, migrating all the content to a Shopify store would be its own major project, so I stuck with redesigning what I had.
