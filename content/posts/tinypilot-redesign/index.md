We . It always felt like the end was just a few weeks away.

TODO: Before and after photos

In the end, the project took eight months and $46k to complete.

And I'm not just blowing $46k wherever. My total revenue last year was XX, and my profit was only XX, so $46k is a lot of money to me.

I don't want to name them, so I'll just call them WebAgency. And this is not a long complaint letter about WebAgency. From my perspective, WebAgency is likely a good fit for a lot of clients. I don't think they were trying to take advantage of me. I think WebAgency acted in good faith, but the project went awry because I didn't have experience working with an agency, and they didn't have experience working with a small software company.

## Not my first rodeo

So, it's possible I'm an idiot, but I did have experience. I've hired dozens of freelancers, including designers and developers. I've never hired an agency for my own business, but I worked with web design agencies when I was at Google.

I've hired before. I've hired many freelancers in the past ten years. I haven't hired many agencies, but I did have some experience working with web design agencies when I was at Google, so I wasn't just coming into this completely cold.

## How it started

The TinyPilot website had always been an afterthought. It was fine, but it looked like I sold a hobby project instead of a hardware device that professionals would use.

I decided it was finally time to fix that, so I started looking for web designers who could help. I interviewed three individual freelancers who quoted me costs of $XX to $XXk for the redesign.

When I spoke to the CEO of WebAgency, he said I should hold off on the redesign and just do a rebranding. WebAgency would make a new logo, color scheme, and font choices. And then I could measure whether that had results. And I could bring that branding to a marketing agency. That sounded smart!

WebAgency's CEO estimated that the rebrand would require 30-40 billable hours over two to four weeks at their hourly rate $175/hour. So, $5-7k for new logo and branding felt reasonable to me. If the rebrand improved TinyPilot's sales, I could hire WebAgency on retainer and have them continue their design work.

WebAgency was the most expensive of the agencies I spoke to, but they also seemed the most competent. I appreciated that they suggested a smaller scope, and they had the most impressive website and portfolio.

WebAgency's CEO did warn me that I was smaller than most of their clients. He said that they have long-term retainer agreements with most of their clients. But he said that this project was so small that we could do it hourly, but there was a possibility that they'd have to pause my work if a retainer client needed more time.

## The honeymoon period

The first month of the project was fantastic.

WebAgency's CEO was on all the calls, as well as the company's lead designer, a senior designer, and a project manager. They'd show me samples of the new logos and branding. I told them what I liked and disliked about the options. They took my feedback graciously, and the next round, we'd be a little closer.

After three or four rounds of feedback, we landed on a logo we all liked:

TODO: Show logo draft

## Scope creep

In parallel with the logo, WebAgency started doing mockups of my site with different fonts and colors. At first, the website was essentially my existing website, but as we continued to meet, they seemed to be spending more time

Sometimes, we'd meet, and there would be no change to the logos or branding. They just wanted to show me design ideas for the website. "To be clear, this project is still just the rebranding, right? We're not redesigning the site itself until later."

"Oh, yes, yes," they reassured me. "Some branding choices won't make sense on top of the old design, so these are just quick sketches of how they could look."

A week later, the designers showed me new design ideas they had for my TinyPilot's blog and About page. This was a big problem, as that was never on the table at all. The spec I'd given them at the start of the project said explicitly that I only was interested in the three pages in the purchase flow: the landing page, the product page, and the shopping cart page.

I emailed the CEO, and he called me. He was embarrassed that the designers had gotten off track. He admitted that the designers went beyond just sketching. He said they were just so excited about the project that they got carried away and designed more than they should have, but he was going to remove the hours for the out of scope work.

I didn't like that they had gone beyond the scope of the rebrand, but I reasoned that they were doing quality work, and I'd probably work with them in the future anyway, so why not do it.

And to be honest, I didn't have time to fuss with anything. I was dealing with the mayhem of launching a new product (TODO: link) and making sure all of our internal workflows were ready to fulfill orders. I just wanted to do the thing that would minimize my time, and that was to just stick with them. It seemed like the design work was mostly 85% done anyway, so why not just spend a few hours on the last 15%?

## Grinding to a halt

In December, our meetings stopped. I checked Figma and would see occasional changes, but the project manager had stopped reaching out to me to arrange check-ins.

When things started up again in January, there was no improvement.

I emailed the CEO laying out my concerns.

## Quit at 80% or start over?

Everything was around 80% done. The logo was almost done, the page designs were done minus a few tweaks and mobile versions. But nothing was complete and usable. I was four months and $XXk into this four-week project, and I had no usable work.

It had taken several weeks to find them. I'd have to start over, transfer partial assets

## Internal turmoil at WebAgency

In February, I laid out the issues in an email to the CEO. We had a call, and he apologized for the way the project is going. He said that WebAgency really wanted to work with me, but I was their only hourly client. They had to prioritize their

Their project manager had quit in November, and the CEO was scrambling to handle project management duties while also recruiting and interviewing new project managers. He admitted some things fell through the cracks, and they hadn't been doing the quality of work he wanted to do for me.

They could protect. They'd finish the design work, likely by March or Apil, but he couldn't guarantee it.

But he had an idea. What if I hired WebAgency on retainer? That way, they could allocate designers and developers to me ahead of time and make sure they're not pulled away to another project.

My initial reaction was outrage. The solution to them doing a poor job was that I have to make an even bigger commitment to them and give them even more money? And if a retainer was better for everyone, why didn't they just ask me to switch back in November? If WebAgency made a mistake, why was I absorbing the cost?

The CEO agreed that it was unfair. He should have told me about the project manager leaving. He refunded me the price I'd paid in November and December as if I'd been on the retainer agreement.

## The last 20% of work costs 80% of the budget

I already had three freelance developers working with me. The main thing I needed from the design agency was design.

Meanwhile, the design agency had been telling me that their strength is the collaboration between their developers and designers. Their developers were well-practiced in implementing designs, so they'd likely be able to code the designs much faster than who I had on staff.

## The postmortem

The big problem seemed to be that TinyPilot is much smaller and budget-sensitive than most of their clients. He said that their typical client has a retainer in the range of $20-40k per month, so they weren't used to working within only 40 hours.

He said that in order to maximize the amount of design and engineering time I received, he minimized project management. He admitted that was a mistake, and he should have included me in that conversation to make sure it was what I wanted.

TinyPilot is smaller. Most clients buy retainers for $20-40k per month.

They typically work on completely new apps or bigger features where it's not valuable to deliver features piecemeal. In my case, it would have been valuable to have them work on projects serially. In other words, if the project is going to take eight months, I get more value from having the new landing page up in month three rather than waiting until month eight for everything to be done.

They minimized project management because of they were low on hours.

They actually could have shared the hours with me. They were tracking billable time with [toggl](https://toggl.com), so he wouldn't have minded just giving me access to their dashboard.

## What I'd do differently

If I were approaching this project again, here are the things I'd do differently, in descending order of importance.

### Narrow the project scope

If there are eight distinct tasks, they can get to 80% of them.

The biggest problem with this project has been in scoping. You might have guessed, given that I'm six months into a six-week project.

Initially, the agency and I agreed that the project was just a rebrand. We'd create a new logo, color scheme, and font for the website and then evaluate the next steps. But then came scope creep. The designers kept silently expanding the scope until I found myself halfway through [a full redesign of the website](/retrospectives/2022/01/#tinypilots-new-logo-and-learning-to-work-with-designers).

I kept feeling like if I let them go for a little longer, they'd wrap up within the month, but things kept dragging. Looking back, I should have just cut my losses and downscoped the project back to the rebranding, as we had originally planned. But I was distracted by the Voyager 2 launch, so the easiest thing for me to do was let the agency keep going.

Even though I thought I learned my lesson, scope creep bit me again this month. I created a project board with outstanding tasks for the redesign in priority order. I booked 60 agency hours for March, but I wasn't sure the design tasks would consume all the hours. I added some low-priority bugs at the end of the list in case the agency had time left over.

You know where this is going...

The design agency left all of the design tasks half-finished, but they used a quarter of my hours for the month to fix all the low-priority bugs.

Going forward, I need to set better expectations so they know not to work on non-critical tasks until all the critical tasks are complete.

### Budget more time for management

The fundamental mistake I made when hiring this agency was underestimating how much time I'd need to manage them.

The agency works with me for 40-60 hours per month. That's the same amount of time as each of TinyPilot's other freelancers, so I thought the agency would require similar oversight to one freelancer. I should have budgeted significantly more time to manage them.

When you work with an agency, you're interacting with multiple people who are working on their own subprojects. More people necessarily means more management time.

For example, suppose a 40-hour/week employee requires six to eight hours/week of management. If you split that role into two people working 20 hours each, your management time would probably balloon to 10-12 hours per week. Your employees are working the same total number of hours, but there's an efficiency loss in communicating with two people instead of just one.

The same logic applies to a design agency. Even if you're getting 40 hours/month of work, the client has to work harder managing six members of an agency than they would if a single freelancer was doing the same work.

### Beware open loops

If you assigned a freelancer tasks A, B, and C, it would be odd if they abruptly stopped working on task A when it was 80% complete and then started working on task B instead. It would be even more bizarre if they stopped midway through task B to start task C.

With an agency, it's easy to end up in a situation where several tasks are only 80% complete. Maybe Alice at the agency only has 10 hours free this month, so she gets 80% through task A. Bob starts next, but he doesn't want to pick up Alice's project midway through, so he starts task B and gets 30% through it. Before you know it, you've spent $39,577, and you can't use any of the work because it's all only 80-90% finished.

In the book _Getting Things Done_, David Allen describes unfinished tasks as "open loops." The more open loops you have, the worse your focus is because each one occupies a bit of real estate in your mind. A freelancer will generally have only a couple of open loops with you at once, whereas a design agency can have 5-10x as many, and they drag on for longer.

Open loops are also worse value for your money. Suppose you need to complete six tasks over the course of six months. If you hired an individual, they'd deliver about one task per month. If you pay them at the end of each month, you're enjoying the benefit of the work around the same time you pay for it. With an agency, they might assign those six tasks to six people who only spend 1/6th of their time on your project. At month five, the agency has 80% of the money, but you're getting 0% of the benefit because none of the tasks are complete yet.

### Require a shared view of billable hours

At the end of March, the agency had a suggestion for the redesign: a new Bootstrap theme. The TinyPilot website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework. We're still using the same free, third-party theme I got from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) when I created the first version of the site. On top of Bootstrap and the third-party theme, we also have our own custom styles, often on a per-page or per-component basis.

The agency pointed out that this architecture was convoluted, and we should replace the third-party theme and per-page styles with our own site-wide Bootstrap theme. They estimated that it would only be a few days of work. It sounded sensible to me. It would probably pay for itself because otherwise the rest of the redesign would be fighting with three different layers of CSS styling.

The theme work ended up taking five weeks for a total cost of $6.1k. Here are the results in terms of what the user can see:

Long-term, this refactoring is helpful, but I wouldn't have chosen to do it right now. The redesign is already six months late and 5x over budget. I'd rather have a pretty website while we work on fixing ugly code than a dumpy-looking website with beautifully-factored code.

So, how did I let this happen? TinyPilot's regular devs rarely get lost in the weeds on something I didn't want, but it keeps happening with the design agency.

One critical difference is that TinyPilot's developers give me low-latency insight into how they spend their time. At the end of each working session, they record their hours with a short note saying what they were working on.

{{<img src="work-timing.png" alt="Screenshot of TinyPilot hours reporting on Deel" hasBorder="true" caption="TinyPilot's in-house developers report their hours as they go.">}}

If I'm expecting work from them, I check their hours. If I see that they've spent 14 hours on a task that I expected to take two, it means I either underestimated the difficulty or explained the task poorly. In either case, I check in with the dev, and we decide whether to continue or course-correct.

With the design agency, there's a much slower feedback loop. They send me an update on the 15th of the month telling me only the total number of hours they've worked. At the end of the month, they send me a full report of where the hours went, but by then, it's too late.

The other issue with the design agency is that they commit to hours only on a monthly basis, not on a weekly basis. In February, they did no dev work for the first three weeks and then squeezed all of their work into the last ten days. This compounded the poor feedback loop since I couldn't distinguish between a task that was taking too long and a task that they hadn't started yet.

If I work with a design agency in the future, I'll insist on using a tool that lets us share a view of billable hours as they happen. The information is too valuable to delay for weeks, as it prevents me from identifying mismatches in expectations.

### Start hourly, then switch to retainer

The agency I'm working with offers both hourly and retainer plans. With hourly, I can buy a block of 30 hours up front, and then the agency works with me until they've consumed those hours. With a retainer plan, I commit to a certain number of hours every month, with a minimum of 40 hours per month. It's a 20% discount from the hourly rate, but unused hours don't roll over, and I have to give 28 days' notice to cancel.

What I didn't realize is that hourly clients can go months starved of resources. I started working with the agency in October, and the work was great for two months but took a massive nosedive in December.

At the time, I thought it was just a holiday slowdown, but when it continued into January, I raised the issue with the owner. He admitted that the agency had lost staff and taken on new retainer clients, so they were finding it difficult to allocate bandwidth for TinyPilot, as I was their only hourly client. He recommended I switch to a retainer agreement to guarantee priority.

I was annoyed. They deprioritized my project and expected me to make a bigger commitment to them? At the same time, I get it. The agency is a small business too, and they want to prioritize long-term clients rather than one-off jobs. The agency told me back in October that I'd get priority as a retainer client, but I didn't realize how much of a difference that would make.

If I were to do it again, I'd buy one 30-hour block as a trial hire for the agency and then switch to a retainer agreement for the remainder of the project. Having guaranteed hours on the agency's schedule seems to yield better quality, as I have protected time on their schedule instead of just a few scattered hours throughout the month.

## What I did well

### Write a spec

When WebAgency started drifting out of scope and redesigning pages outside of TinyPilot's purchase flow, the CEO was embarrassed and told me I was 100% correct because he knew I'd spelled that out in the spec.

Clients take you much more seriously if you write a spec. A lot of clients will wait for the freelancer or agency to tease information out of them.

You feel like you don't know where to begin, but you actually know a lot. Just write down what you can think of.

### Automate

They're rotating between projects, so they're unlikely to remember your style conventions.

I had CI checks and everything, but I didn't have pre-commit checks, they were relying on CI to catch things the linter could have caught in two seconds. I didn't notice because I have the linter hooked up to my IDE.

## Why didn't you just...?

As I've shared snippets of stories. I think I certainly made mistakes, but I think the people that think a project like this is trivial to manage have never managed a project like this. Or they have, and they don't realize that their code is garbage, and if they ever have to make changes, they'll have to essentially start over.

### Why didn't you just use a Shopify template?

### Why didn't you just refuse to pay them until the work was done?

They required payment up-front. I had no leverage to force them to complete the project. The contract just said .

If I had pushed for milestone-based payments from the start, they likely would have just declined the project. I think they saw me as a small client who could grow to something more substantial, but nobody wants to work with a tiny client who's going to be demanding about the budget.

### Why didn't you just find a cheap developer to do it for $4/hr?

They've either never hired anyone or they've never had to maintain code from a bargain basement developer.

### Why didn't you just fire them and hire someone better?

If you know of a place where you can reliably hire skilled web developers

It would have taken an extra 20-80 hours of my time. I have to interview candidates, ramp them up on the codebase. It was possible I'd run into the same problems or worse and then have to start over again multiple times. With Design Crew, I at least had confidence the work would get done to my standards eventually if I let them continue.
