I've been in the world of bootstrapped founders for about seven years. I used to organize Indie Hacker meetups in New York City, and I continue to organize them in Western Massachusetts. I've worked full-time as a bootstrapped founder for the past six years and try as much as possible to connect with other founders.

When people start a bootstrapped business, they're usually excited. They've read stories online of other founders like Pieter Levels or XX. And they're excited to build the business. And then it doesn't

##

I was at a meetup a few years ago and one of the people who attended had quit his job in big tech to pursue his own business. That was cool because it was exactly what I had done.

He told me he regretted it. I was sad for him. He felt like he got taken in by the hype of bootstrapped businesses.

The way he was talking, he sounded like he'd been banging his head against the walls for years. I asked him how long he'd been trying to build his business. "Almost three months," he told me.

I was floored. He was so grizzled, I thought for sure it would have been at least a year.

## I haven't "made it"

Before I go further, I just want to clarify that I'm not speaking as the bootstrapped founder who's got everything figured out and now can dole out advice. I have had one successful business out of about ten serious attempts, and it sold for a modest exit.

## The Instagram reality of bootstrapper media

This is not to say that founders are lying or fabricating their numbers. But when you listen to interviews or watch videos about successful founders, there are a ton of biases at play that are distorting reality and your expectations.

First, and most obviously, interviews that get attention are only with successful founders. An article called, "I launched my product three months ago, and I'm earning $50k/month" is going to receive much more attention than an article called, "I launched my product two years ago, and I'm not even covering my costs."

Second, even when you listen to the founders who actually are successful, they're giving a glamorized version of their company. Being a founder is busy. The main reason a lot of founders

Finally, the media outlets themselves want to focus on the positives. Occasionally, they'll have a Very Special Episode about mental health, but 99% of it is about how being a bootstrapped founder is fun and exciting. And being a bootstrapped founder is fun and exciting, but it's also a lot of other things that are hard to handle if you expect the experience to be 100% fun and exciting.

TODO: Visualization of selection bias and exaggeration.

## Wild success is so close to abject failure

XX years after I wrote about quitting Google, I found a blog post about a guy who did something similar. Daniel Vassallo had left a a well-paid position at Amazon to try bootstrapping his own business.

Over the next year, I saw Daniel succeed wildly. He basically had the experience that a lot of optimistic founders expect to have.

Based on his experience at Amazon, he co-wrote an e-book called "AWS: The Good Parts." He'd never had a Twitter account, but he joined because he heard that's where people might be interested in his book. He tweeted about

Daniel realized he was so successful at promoting his book on Twitter, and the market for promoting things on Twitter is so much larger than the market for people who want to learn AWS, so he made a video course about building an audience on Twitter.

And then he realized people were so fascinated with his story that he made a private community for people who wanted to follow his business strategy.

I think Daniel is a smart guy, and I'm a satisfied customer of several of his products, but it's unmistakable how much luck played into Daniel's success.

Let's imagine we rewind the story to just after Daniel publishes his AWS book, and everything is the same except that Twitter's algorithm is slightly different. Now, Daniel is tweeting all the same stuff, but Twitter shows it to 1% of the people it did in our timeline. Instead of making $150k, he makes $1.5k.

He probably doesn't see it as a wild success, and even if he does, nobody's going to want to buy a course from someone who tweets all day and only managed to make $1.5k from it. And people certainly aren't going to pay money to join Daniel's private community when he has no success to show.

So, what happens to Daniel Vassallo in that timeline? Daniel's smart, so maybe he keeps trying new things until he finds success, but it's easy to imagine the Daniel of that timeline following the path of so many other bootstrapped founders. His first few swings all miss, he assumes that he's not cut out for the bootstrapper lifestyle, and he goes back to his job in big tech.

## How to get a more grounded reality

If you want a more accurate picture, listen to interviews with people after they've moved on from their company. It's a very different picture, one filled with a lot of fear, stress, and anxiety.

Listen to founders who do interviews because they're business nerds and don't have anything to sell. I love every Jason Cohen interview because he clearly doesn't need to promote his businesses, but he enjoys sharing what he's learned.
