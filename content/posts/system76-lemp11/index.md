For the past

## Use cases

My main uses are:

- Doing video calls
- Watching streaming TV shows while I eat lunch
- Light emailing and development when I travel
- Presenting talks at conferences

## Why the switch?

Recent trip, Surface Pro 6 couldn't handle running two small Docker containers. Limited by 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of SSD.

## Options I considered

### Surface Pro 7+

I came extremely close to giving in and sticking with Microsoft. I got to the point of going through the checkout process on an eBay listing and then deciding to sleep on it another night before I completed the purchase.

### System76 Pangolin

For $100 more, I could get a CPU that's XX% faster, 33% more RAM, and a 15.6" screen instead of 14.1". It would cost me $100 extra and 1.4 lbs (XX%) of extra weight. I felt like it wasn't worth it.

### Framework

- Didn't want to build it myself
- And then I have to pay for a Windows license I don't want.

I don't really want to build my own laptop. I enjoy building my own PCs, but for some reason, the prospect of building a laptop feels unappealing. I think it's the idea of everything having to fit in tight spaces.

### Starlabs Starbook

UK based

Checkout experience was bad

### Tuxedo Infinitybook

I only briefly looked at it and stopped when I couldn't find USD pricing anywhere and several parts of the site were available exclusively in German.
