description: Five years ago today, I quit my job as a developer at Google to create my own self-funded software business. This is a review of my last year and what I've learned so far about bootstrapping software businesses.

Five years ago, I [quit my job as a developer at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to create my own bootstrapped software company.

For the first few years, all of my businesses flopped. They all operated at a loss, and none of them earned more than a few hundred dollars per month in revenue.

Halfway through my third year, I created a network administration device called [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com). It quickly caught on, and it's been my main focus ever since.

In 2022, TinyPilot generated $XXk in revenue, a XX% increase from 2021.

In this post, I'll share what I've learned from TinyPilot about being a bootstrapped founder.

## What happened this year?

### I bet big on a large customer and lost

### I overspent on a website redesign, but the results paid for themselves

### TinyPilot's teams matured

Last year, one of my lessons was that I had to stop protecting my team from doing work outside their role and instead let my teammates expand their roles as the company grew. It started with having one member of the fulfillment team take over customer service from me.

In 2022, we continued by adding more teams. Eric doesn't have a background in software, so he had to escalate technical issues to me. In April, I hired TinyPilot's support engineer. They filled most of the gaps between Eric and I

In August, I went out of town for a wedding, but Eric was sick. I realized that the customer service team can't just be a single person.

Similar to the lesson I learned about customer support, I hired an additional technical support engineer. A month later, I unfortunately had to let the first support engineer go due to issues with their work, but I hired a second new support engineer. At this point, they're

### I got burned a lot with PCB manufacturing

TinyPilot has been using custom PCBs

## Lessons learned

### Run at 50% capacity on average

If a popular YouTube channel mentions you, your sales can double overnight. If you were already running at near-capacity, you'll fold when demand doubles.

Instead, what I aim for with TinyPilot is to run at around 50% capacity. That is, a balance of 50% reactive work and 50% proactive work. For the technical support team, they spend around half of their time responding to support requests and half of their time proactively preventing support requests. That includes things like writing tutorials and troubleshooting guides, adding diagnostics to the product to make troubleshooting easier, or making fixes to the code to prevent issues in the first place.

## Do I still love it?

Every year, when I write these blog posts, I ask myself whether I still love what I'm doing.

2022 was a hard year &mdash; certainly my hardest since going off on my own. I wasn't miserable, but I didn't love it either.

The things I enjoy doing most are programming and writing, and the past year gave me little time for either. I spent most of my time on TinyPilot scrambling to keep up with demand, filling in gaps as we grew, and putting out small fires.

Hardest year. No time for writing, little time for writing software.
