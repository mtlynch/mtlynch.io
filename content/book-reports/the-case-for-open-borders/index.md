If you're a progressive liberal who's interested in becoming a radical progressive, this is a good book for you. If you're anyone else, you may not be the audience.

I knew from the title that the book's argument would be radical, but I didn't realize that the arguments were for a fairly narrow audience of people who already want to eliminate capitalism, so eliminating borders is also a good idea.

I found the book frustrating in a lot of ways.

The author counds up all the harms of border control and reasons that they cause so much harm, so we should get rid of them. But this reasoning is like a parable for Chesteron's Fence. The author never considers why every sovreign nation has borders or why borders might be beneficial outside of nefarious reasons like protecting the controlling elite.

Ann equivalent to Washington's argument is that locks on house doors are bad. Every year, Americans pay millions for door locks and key replacements. And you can sometimes lose your keys, and then you get locked out of your house. So because of those harms, we should elimiate locks. But that would be ridiculous because it ignores the benefits of locks - namely, that they reduce the chances of burglary and assault in your home.
