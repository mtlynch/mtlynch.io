If you're a progressive liberal who's interested in becoming a radical progressive, this is a good book for you. If you're anyone else, you may not be the audience.

I found the book frustrating in a lot of ways.

I hoped the author would consider the benefits of borders and weight them against the harms and make the case that the harms outweigh the benefits. Instead, the author was unable or unwilling to see any legitimate reason for a nation to enforce limits or criteria on who may enter.

Instead of evaluating pros and cons, the author enumerates all the harms of border control and concludes that we should abolish them because of these harms. This is basically like arguing that because you sometimes forget your keys and can't use your car, we should just get rid of car keys and make cars accessible to any person who wants to use one.

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

The author also assumes that the reader shares his far left worldview that capitalism shouldn't exist and that Western countries have an obligation to provide not just free passsage, but travel assistance and social welfare to any person anywhere in the world who wants to relocate to the US or Europe.

I did learn some interesting details that improved my understanding of immigration, but overall, I felt like the author and I differed too much in fundamental beliefs about citizenship, so the arguments didn't resonate with me.

## What I Liked

- It's [available as a DRM-free ebook](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2199-the-case-for-open-borders). I never see that for books I find in the bookstore.

## What I Disliked

- The arguments are lacking in nuance. The author only considers the harms of immigration policies and uses that to justify abolishing them without considering any benefits.
- The author is uncharitable in painting proponents of immigration controls. They're presented as seething xenophobes or greedy elites.
- Repeatedly claims borders are not necessary but has no examples of any modern society with totally open borders.
- Most of the people he quotes aren't policy experts but philosophers, poets, and activists.
- Bizarre extreme position where author argues that even illegal immigrants who commit violent crime don't deserve arrest b/c the US justice system is inhumane, and it's America's fault for driving the immigrant to commit the crime to begin with.
- Casually dismisses the idea that restricting entry to a country is like a private home, but it's not convincing
- The author repeatedly makes the argument that borders aren't "real" in that they're defined arbitrarily and change over time, therefore they're not legitimate
- will often argue advantages of illegal immigrants by lumping them together with legal immigrants
- Bad with causality, often points to economic increase after migration and credits migration rather than larger trends

## Key Takeaways

- Poor sourcing, often refers to particular studies without citing them, making it difficult to check claims
- Between 1800 - 1900, 3/4 of all global immigration was to the US
- The US deports more people than any other country
- Americans grossly overestimate the percentage of the population that are immigrants
- The US has destabilized many other countries through diplomatic policies and active intervention. We therefore have an obligation to clean up the mess we created
- Western countries contribute to climate change more severely than most impoverished countries, and global warming is making some areas of the world uninhabitable. The US has a responsibility to those people
- Similarly, argues that borders are often imperfect and interfere with historical behavior of human tribes or animal species. And somehow because they're imperfect, they should not exist at all
- Argues that borders can cause rather than prevent violence. In the context of Israel, it seems absurd to imagine peace if Israel simply stopped defending its borders
- Forced removal of Native Americans during the 1830s cost about $1T in 2023 dollars
- In 1836, 40% of federal spending was on deportation of Native Americans
- In 2019, US spent $11M/day on immigrant detention centers
- 62% of detention beds are in private, for-profit prisons
- Homes are private and "sacred"
- Homes are usually designed for a single family whereas countries contain many people
- A home is protected by property rights
- Impact on wages and unemployment
  - 2007 study by Giovanni Peri found that immigration does not increase unemployment or reduce wages
- 1929 Mexican Repatriation Act deported 2M people, many US citizens. Later analyses found that deportations hurt the economy
  - Ed: Causality here is suspect
- Undocumented immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in measurable government benefits p. 79
- In the US, do these studies exclude value of public school?
- 1980 Mariel Boatlift
  - In 1979, a series of agricultural crises hit Cuba along with fishing limitations due to diplomatic failures
  - As a result, Cuban economy was struggling, and thousands of Cubans were trying to escape the country
  - Jimmy Carter tried to undermine the Cuban gov't by highlighting how many Cubans were trying to leave
  - Fidel Castro publicly announced that Cuban Americans could pick up their relatives from Mariel
  - Due to the US Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Cubans only get a green card after 1 year of residency and could get work authorization immediately regardless of how they arrived
  - 125,000 Cubans migrated from Cuba to Florida, 100k in just 6 weeks
  - Increased labor force by 7% in Miami, was 20% increase in Cuban
  - Before boatlift, Miami had highest proportion of foreign workers at 35.5%, significantly higher than LA's #2 at 22%
  - Wages for Black workers increased over next 5 years, wages for non-Cuban Latinos stayed steady, wages for pre-existing Cubans fell, wages for Whites not mentioned
- Other migrations
  - From 1989 - 1995, 610k people migrated from Russia to Israel, increasing population by 12%. Wages increased and unemployment dropped
- Terrorism
  - A Cato Institute study found that nobody who entered US illegally has committed an act of terror, although 7 were arrested for plotting one
- Radcliffe line
  - In 1947, British lawyer Cyril Radcliffe was assigned to divide up Punjab and Bengal, as UK was abdicating rule
  - Radcliffe divided the region by religion between India and Pakistan, but it was impossible to create a simple line border, so there were enclosed parts that were exceptions
  - [Dahala Khagrabari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahala_Khagrabari) - a pocket of Indian territory within Bangladeshi territory within Indian territory
  - Partition displaced 14 million people and killed up to 2 million
  - Radcliffe line stops in Kashmir and left India & Pakistan to figure out the rest
  - That led to a war and the Line of Control, which is a de facto border but still not legally recognized
- US Capacity for Migrants
  - 75% of US pop. lives on 3.5% of its land
  - Population density per sq. mi:
    - US: 86
    - France: 350
    - Belgium: 976
    - Bangladesh: 2980
    - Singapore: 20,000
  - US population could triple and be less crowded than France
  - Thomas Sowell observed that the entire world population could fit in TX with single family homes and yards
- Americans overestimate immigrants
  - [2021 Cato study](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/e-pluribus-unum-findings-cato-institute-2021-immigration-identity-national-survey) found Americans think 40% of US population is immigrants, but it's actually 14%
