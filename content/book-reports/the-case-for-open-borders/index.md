If you're a progressive liberal who's interested in becoming a radical progressive, this is a good book for you. If you're anyone else, you may not be the audience.

I found the book frustrating in a lot of ways.

I hoped the author would consider the benefits of borders and weight them against the harms and make the case that the harms outweigh the benefits. Instead, the author was unable or unwilling to see any legitimate reason for a nation to enforce limits or criteria on who may enter.

Instead of evaluating pros and cons, the author enumerates all the harms of border control and concludes that we should abolish them because of these harms. This is basically like arguing that because you sometimes forget your keys and can't use your car, we should just get rid of car keys and make cars accessible to any person who wants to use one.

The author also assumes that the reader shares his far-left worldview that capitalism shouldn't exist and that Western countries have an obligation to provide not just free passsage, but travel assistance and social welfare to any person anywhere in the world who wants to relocate to the US or Europe.

I knew from the title that the book's argument would be radical, but I didn't realize that the arguments were for a fairly narrow audience of people who already want to eliminate capitalism, so eliminating borders is also a good idea.
