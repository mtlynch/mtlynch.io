The reading experience was hit or miss. Some chapters were fascinating and taught me valuable Go lessons, while others felt boring and got too bogged down in particular third-party libraries. Overall, I'd still recommend it as a valuable read for anyone who considers themselves a beginner or intermediate with the Go programming language.

## What I Liked

- The variety of example apps did a good job of demonstrating features of Go in realistic scenarios.
- Features wonderfully elegant Go code that taught me several new idiomatic language patterns.
- Does a great job of using the Go standard library in interesting ways.

## What I Disliked

- Most of the examples focus on highly scalable applications rather than single-server Go applications that I typically write.
- Overly dependent on heavy Google libraries (e.g., Maps, OAuth, gRPC, AppEngine).
  - Often got bogged down in minutiae of a particular library rather than the Go-relevant parts of the solution.
- Poor editing in the prose and error checking in the code.
  - There were tons of careless grammar and code mistakes.
  - Users have [submitted fixes](https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr), but they've been ignored for years.
