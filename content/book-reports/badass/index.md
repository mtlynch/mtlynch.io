TODO: Short summary

She wanted to write a book about meta-learning and shoehorned it into a book about user experience.

## What I Liked

* Interesting discussion of meta -learning and deliberate practice.
* It's laugh out loud funny.
  * Enjoyable use of stock photos.

## What I Disliked

* Feels like it gets too into the weeds on the subject of meta-learning.
* Strategies are for products that have extremely large teams.
  * Most of the examples are Olympus cameras and Microsoft Office products.
  * Would have benefited from other examples.
  * Too abstract.
  * Hard to connect to my product.
* Does not make a convincing case that this is practical.
  * Almost all of the discussion is theory or results of scientific study.

## Key Takeaways

### The brand engagement arms race

* Out-egnaging competing brands is not sustainable.
* Users don't fall in love with a product by engaging with it on social media.

> On their deathbed, nobody will say, "If only I'd engaged with more brands."

* Best-selling products maintain their position through social recommendations.
  * When someone loves a product, they tell people.
* When people talk about a product's funny viral video, they're discussing the product's *marketing*, which isn't the goal.

### Goal of user experience

>Which of the following do you want the user to feel after using your product if you can pick only one?
>* A. "This **product** is awesome."
>* B. "This **company** is awesome."
>* C. "This **brand** is awesome."

>Answer: Secret option D: "**I'm** awesome."

Takeaway: People love products for what the product helped them become or achieve.

### What makes badass users?

* We make our users badass when our product helps them achieve badass results.
  * e.g., an effective presentation, a beautiful photograph
* To identify badass results for our product, we need to think about the context in which customers user our product.
  * e.g., nobody wants to be the best at tripods, but people use tripods to make excellent photographs.
* Companies often market their product in terms of the greater context.
  * After the customer buys the product, all the company's messaging around the product treats it as a simple tool and forgets about the context.

### The value of expert users

* The more expertise someone has in a field, the more they appreciate fine details.
  * e.g., audiophiles pay for expensive headphones because they hear a richer sound with them.
* We want to make our users experts so that they have a richer experience and value the fine details of our product.
* Expert users are more likely to evangelize the tools they use and share their results.

### Auto mode vs. manual mode

* If you sell a camera, an "auto" mode helps users get started, but you want them to grow past that crutch and master the camera's manual controls.
* If your tool doesn't have more advanced controls, figure out how to help users produce better results with your tool.
  * e.g., if you sell a point-and-shoot camera, you can still help users with lighting and digital editing.

### Building expertise

* When building expertise in any domain, you can think of your skills in that domain as falling into one of three buckets:

1. Can't do
1. Can do with effort
1. Mastered (reliable, automatic)

* It's not as simple as moving each skill from 1 -> 2 -> 3.
* Experts move skills from 2 back to 2 in order to keep growing and refine their skills.
* Experts continuously find new skills to add to the "can't do" bucket so that they're constantly improving.
* "Use it or lose it" is misleading.
  * Skills deteriorate even if you use them if you're not consciously refining them.

### Deliberate practice

* Deliberate practice separates experts from non-experts.
* A key element of deliberate practice is keeping the "can do with effort" bucket small.
  * Practicing too many skills at once is inefficient and usually counterproductive.

### Half a skill beats half-assed skill

TODO: Show boards

* It's better to have more, tinier skills in the unconscious / masters board than a bunch of big, clumsy skills in the conscious board.
 * Exception: It's okay if the user has to rely on half-learned skills to get to the point of doing something useful with your product.

### Designing for deliberate practice

* Pick a subskill you can't do reliably but could get to 95% reliability in three sessions of 45-90 mins
* Examples:
  * Play a section of music at half-speed w/o errors
  * Shoot a basketball from 8-12 ft. from the hoop.
* If you can't get to 95% reliability in 3 sessions, split the task into smaller subtests or reduce success criteria.
* Not all practice is deliberate practice
  * Watching a lecture is not
  * Following a tutorial is not
  * Practicing a skill you already know is not

### Why isn't deliberate practice more common?

 * By definition, it's outside of our comfort zone.
 * It's more attractive to do things we already know in the hopes of getting incrementally better.

### Masters have better exposure

* Experts generally have exposure to other experts that help them learn

### Training chicken sexers

* Large commercial chicken forms need to determine a chicken's sex as early as possible.
* "Chicken sexing" is the practice of identifying a chicken's gender at a glance.
* In the 1900s, Japan trained expert chicken sexers.
  * The chicken sexers can identify the chickens' gender with near-perfect accuracy, but they don't consciously know what gives them the answer, and they can't explain why they believe a chicken is one gender or another.
 * To train new chicken sexers, a trainee stands next to an expert, examines a chick, makes a guess, and then the expert tells them whether or not their guess was correct. Eventually, the trainee develops an accurate intuition for chicken sexing.

###  Perceptual Exposure

* Experts learn though repeated perceptual exposure.
* Effective training involves showing a student a large number of examples that have persistent patterns but feel varied to the learner.
  * The learner must receive frequent feedback about their accuracy
* The brain learns better if it can "discover" a concept rather than just hear it explained,
  * There are subtleties to skills that you don't learn if someone explains the concept.

### Creating an effective perceptual experience

* Show then a high volume of good examples in a compressed amount of time.
* Limit bad examples
  * The brain tends to mimic patterns it sees, even if it consciously knows they're negative examples.
* When showing bad ecomples, make them "feel" bad (e.g., big X's, scary red font).

### Be honest about struggle

* Users start out excited to learn expertise in a tool, bad then they get discouraged and stop.
* It's a mistake to encourage them by emphasizing the goal more.
  * The user is already motivated to reach the goal.
  * They stop because reaching the goal is hard, not because they've lost interest in it.
* Be honest about which parts of the learning curve are difficult.
 * e.g. the first day someone learns to snowboard, they dislike it. Then, it starts to become fun. They need to know the xp unpleasant part is normal and expected.

### Freedom to experiment

* Users are reluctant to experiment with your product if they're afraid of breaking it
* Give users an easy way to reset to stock settings so they don't worry about experimenting
