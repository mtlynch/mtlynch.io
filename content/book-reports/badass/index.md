## What I Liked

* Interesting discussion of meta -learning and deliberate practice.
* It's laugh out loud funny. Enjoyable use of stack photos,

## What I Disliked

* Feels like it gets too into the weeds on the subject of meta-learning
* Strategies are for products that are really large and
* Examples are Excel and Olympus
* Wan. Does not make a convincing case tht this is practical. Almost all of the. scientific discussion is theory or results of radar study

## Key Takeaways

Half a skill Beers Half-Asset still

It's better to have mere, tinier skills in the unconscious /masters board than a bunch of big, clumsy skills in the conscious broad.

 * Exception! It's okay if the user has to rely on half-learned skills to get to the point of doing something useful with your product.

Designing for deliberate practice

 * Pick a subsk,'ll you can't do reliably but could get to 95% reliability in three sessions of 45-90 mins
 * Examples Play a section of music at half-speed w/o errors
 * Shoot a basketball from F- 12 It. from the hoop.
 * If you can't get to 95% reliability in 3 sessions, split the task into

smaller subtests o- reduce success criteria.

 * Not all practice is deliberate practice
 * Watching a lecture is not
 * Following a tutorial is not
 * Practicing a skill -you already know is not

Why isn't deliberate practice more Conon?

 * It's harder because it's by definition outside of our comfort zone.
 * It's more attractive to do things we already know in the hopes of getting incrementally better. Master, have better exposure
 * Experts generally have exposure to other experts that help them learn

Training chicken sexers

Large commercial chicken forms need to determine a chicken's six as early as possible.

Japan trained In the 19005, expert chicken sexes

 * The chicken sexers can identify the chickens' gender with near - perfect accuracy, but they don't consciously know what gives them the answer, and they can't explain why they believe a chicken is one gender or another
 * To train new chicken sepers, a trance stands next to an expert, examines a chick, makes a guess, and then learns from the expert if they're correct. Perceptual Exposure
 * Experts learn though repeated perceptual exposure.
 * Effective training involves storing a student a large number of examples that have persistent patterns but feel varied to the learner.
 * The lever must receive frequent feedback about their accuracy

 * The brain learns better if it can "discover"' a concept rather than just hear it explained,
 * There are subtleties to skills that you don't learn if someone just explains the concept.
 * Creating an effective perceptual experience learning for your uses
 * Show then a high volume of good ðŸ’” examples in a compressed amount of time
 * Limit bad examples
 * The brain tends to mimic patterns it sees, even if it consciously tenors they're anti-examples,
 * When showing bad ecomples, make them ' 'feel'' bad , big X's , scary red fort
Be Honest about struggle

 * Users start ont excited to learn expertise in a tool, bad then they get discouraged and stop.

 * A mistake is to try to harder to entice them with the goal.
 * It's better to just be honest about parts of the process that are hard.
 * e, g, the first day or two someone learns to snowboard , they dislike it, but then it starts to become fan. They need to know the xp unpleasant part is normal and expected.
Freedom to experiment

 * Users are reluctant to experiment with your product if they're afraid of breaking it
 * Give users an easy way to reset to stock settings so they don't worry about experimenting
