## What I Liked

-

## What I Disliked

- Careless grammar and spelling errors,
- Non-standard format for citing made me question research
- Would have liked to see a better representation of objection to his ideas
- Fairly theoretical - would have liked to see more evidence that his policies work in practice
- Conclusions from using value per acre seen to be measuring the wrong thing.
- If poor neighborhoods outperform rich neighborhoods in finance' productivity, why do poor towns struggle to pay for services and rich towns don't?

## Key Takeaways

### Pompeii as a model city

- Author visited ruins of Pompeii and found building that was an ancient equivalent of a fast-food restaurant
- The restaurant was in a two-room building where the back room was a living space and the front room had a serving counter facing the street.
- The restaurant had many characteristics that made it adaptive to different conditions. Living quarters mean that parents can attend to children while working
- One parent can work. elsewhere while the other mind, the shop,
- Restaurant is on the edge of town, so the restaurant owners (and all shopkeepers) have incentive to help the town as a whole grow because an expanded city increase value of their business
- Shared walls with neighboring businesses meant lover heating costs.
- Clea neighbors mean, better security,
- The building is simple, which rant that it could be converted to something else if the restaurant folded or expanded if the restaurant flourished.
- Cities are complex, not just complicated
- Complicated systems can have simple behavior.
- e. g. , a mechanical watch is complicated, but predictable
- Cities are both complicated and complex
- they contain interrelated systems that are difficult to predict
- Complex systems are fragile and need flexibility to adapt in order to survive.
- people traditionally manage cities with zoning for ease of legislation, but zoning is too simple and limits tap the city from adapting naturally
- Postwar WWII wealth screwed up city management.
- Us had an abundance of wealth and so stopped designing cities with financial constraints in mind.
  Evolution of Brainerd, MN

- Author found a photo of Brainerd, MN this hometown) in its early days. "There are a set of makeshift ads stores but no real road.

- 30 years later, there were roads, and the makeshift stores were replaced by well-constructed to 2-3 strey buildings,
- 30 years after that, the wood buddy would be replaced by store buildings.
- Through most of history, this is the way that cities normally developed.
- Businesses would make small bets on a new area, then incrementally build more as the area succeeded
- Importantly, private investment came first, then public investment (e.g., roads, police) follows.
- The private sector bears the risk
- Modern city planning makes big bets on the public side
- The public makes huge investments in infrastructure before private

business

move

- We build everything to a finished state instead of fostering adaptation and incremental improvement
- Houses are also built to finished state due to the friction involved in modifying a house .
- Prior to 1920s, houses were mostly simple boxes, and they were built to make it easy to add on to them if conditions in your life changed
- Several factors prevent houses from evolving
- Zoning laws often forbid turning a single family house into a multi-family house or a business. + land covenants, building regulations, property associations
- Building regulations increase

the cost, time, and difficulty of modifying a house

- Building everything at once that everything needs
  means

maintenance or replacement in bi waves, whereas incremental growth means maintenance requirements are smoothed out over time.

Property value -Building value + Land value

- The amount you'd invest in a building is a function of the value of the land underneath.
- e. g. the value of a 410m building in downtown Manhattan is far more than Som ble Manhattan has such valuable land.
- the value of a $10 M building placed in outer Detroit is colon. Sugg which indicates the land has negative value.

- Yo,'d never buy land in Manhattan to park a mobile home because there are much more lucrative structures to put on such valuable land.
- When building value is high relative to the land, it drives up the value of the surrounding land
- e.g., a fancy hotel makes the area more valuable
- When building value is low relative to land value, there's redevelopment pressure
- e. g. , if a small home is in an expensive neighborhood , it's profitable to tear it down or expand the building. .
- This guides natural growth of cities. I. A few people build shacks

together in a new area. 2- . More people join then and build

more shacks nearby.

- 3.  The land becomes more valuable because it has more buildings clustered together, redevelop-
      Y. Redevelopment pressure pushes some

owners to renovate their shacks into better structures.

- 5.  The nice- buildings have incentive to invest in shared infrastructure like reads and fire protection.
- 6.  The info structure increases land value, incentivizing more redevelopment.
- The flaw in this pattern is that it limits social mobility.
- As a town is growing, poorer residents can grow with it.
- Once a city reaches maturity, land is only affordable to the entrenched

elites.

Enter Cars

- Cars influenced urban design in the 50s under the idea that connecting two places w/ roads / highways would increase the value of both.
- A more connected city is more valuable.
- Instead, it drove down land prices because suburbanization meant people could live much farther from city centers.
- Tons of new land opened up for housing.
- Cars upended the traditional pattern for growing and sustaining cities.
- As land values in city centers dropped, there was insufficient try revenue to pay for maintenance.

Public & Private investment

Case study: Brainerd

- First generation: pop-up shacks, no sewage or sidewalks
- Second generation'. Two-and three- story wood buildings, sidewalks, gravel streets
- Third generation: Brick and granite buildings, concrete sidewalks, asphalt streets.
- Takeaway: private investment precedes public investment,
- More private wealth creates incentive
  to invest in shared infrastructure

- Current development strategy
- Public investment precedes private investment
- Government takes on most of the risk
- When private developers make initial investment, government still often

finances the deal, making them

take on the risk if development fails.

- Government also assumes longterm Maintenance responsibilities.
- When development is built to a finished state instead of growing organically and incrementally, early residents are dis incentivized to let the town grow.
- Every additional resident means more people using limited resources like roads, ports, libraries
  Profit

- A city must earn a profit in the long term to continue existing
- A city that has at a defeat long-term will begin to far.) in the services it's supposed to provide

- Cities make investments that must earn a return.
- If a city invests 5) IM in repairing a street , the street must generate> slim ove its lifetime for the investment to be worthwhile
- Government buildings as an investment
- Traditional cities invested heavily in government buildings like city halls.
- Current strategy is to build city hall in a cheap office building with lots of parking,
- An opulent city hall increased the value of the surrounding land and earned a return on investment From greater tax revenue from the neighborhood,

- Infrastructure does not cover costs.
- In the author's role as engineer, he began calculating return on investment for various projects his firm was involved in.
- In almost every project, the city planned to spend more on the project than it would recoup in taxes for the 20-40
  next years.

- Jobs don't benefit a city.
- Infrastructure proponents often cite job creation as a reason to take on infrastructure projects.
- The city does not benefit financially from job creation because in-meter go to the state, not local government
- Job City us House City
- 1,000 people live is House City, but every day they all commute to Job city to

work in small tents.

- Even though Job city has all the jobs, it would have nearly Zero tax revenue because only House city collects taxes from the homeowners,
- Growth - dependent city finance
- Suppose a city accepted a land development from a private investor.
- Investor puts up all the money, but the city is responsible for maintenance.
  infrastructure

- Cash flow will be positive for first 15- 20 years as city collects tax revenue from new residents.
- As soon as development requires maintenance (e.g. road repair, sewage repair), cash flow goes severely negative because infrastructure built around the same time will require repair around the same time,

- Cities try to solve the cash flow problem by soliciting ne - development, but that just delays & intensifies the problem. study: Detroit
- Case
- Many see the downfall of Detroit as result of government corruption.
- Author sees Detroit's failure as the same that will befall most US cities,
- Detroit was the first city designed around cars.
- Detroit spread residents out to the suburbs and ran roadways through cities,
- This created more infrastructure maintenance costs then the city could afford..
- When wealthy people saw the city start to collapse under growing maintenance costs, they fled

to cities that were still in the growth part of their lifecycle.

- The loss of tax revenue from residents leaving accelerated the collapse.
  The Infrastructure Cult

- Investing in infrastructure is popular politically, but it's often irrational.
- Cities spend millions on new roads while they're struggling to maintain their existing roads.
- Failure to Act
- In their 2011 report, failure to Act, the ASCE made illogical Claims about America's need to invest in infrastructure.
- Report claimed that weaknesses is infrastructure would cost SIT over the next 10 yrs.

- Recommended that US spend an extra $220 Blye to prevent infrastructure from deteriorating,
- i. e., US should spend $2.25 to avoid a loss of $ IT.
  Returns from infrastructure projects are

overstated.

- When planners estimate that a new road will generate $ X of value, they calculate something like:
- Road will save drivers an average of 30s per day.
- look people drive on the road per day
- Road will save 3M seconds per day (XX hours) wage in the area is $25) m
- Median
- Road generates $XX per day . $xX per year
- Flaws

- Ignores time lost due to construction and maintenance.
- People don't necessarily use an e-ta 30s to work more.
- They might sleep in longer.
- They might move farther for their job.
- Irrational municipal accounting,
- Cities have balance sheets listing assets and liabilities
- According to generally accepted accounting principles, infrastructure is considered an asset,
- This makes no sense because a city can't sell a road and it doesn't directly earn revenue from it.
- Even though the city earns reverse from properties in its city, the tax base does not count as an asset.

- Cities are incentivized to add infrastructure because it will make their balance sheets look stronger, even though, in reality, infrastructure drains money.
  Post WWII

- Us experienced unprecedented prosperity after WWII
- Led to lots of infrastructure projects and suburban expansion around cities,
- This changed urban planning because cities could expand and grow without caring about costs because so much money was flowing into the economy.
  Funding growth through debt

- After the economy slowed down following the 50's, cities took on debt as a way to find

growth,

- This only works if the economy grows in the future, as infrastructure investments rarely earn a positive return.
- Cities get stuck in a cycle of relying on debt to pay for infrastruct. then needing even more debt to keep going.
- Lafayette, LA
- Between 1949 and 2015, infrastructure. growth far outstripped income.
- 1,000% increase in pipes per capita
- 2,140% increase in fire hydrants per capita
- 160% increase in average inflation adjusted income
- Old & blighted us. new & shiny
- In author's hometown, there are two similar blocks close to each

other.

- Old and blighted: a series of pop up shacks built in early 19005 that include pawn shop, bankruptcy attorney, and local restaurant.
- New and shiny: a franchise restaurant that moved in and added its own parking lot, allowing the city to eliminate street parking in fan of supporting more traffic.
- Comparing by taxable revenue
- Old and blighted! total taxable value of businesses ' . $1. I M
- Ner and shiny: $ 620k
- old generates 77% more revenue.
- Impact on community
- Businesses in the old block hire employees locally and use local vendors for things like accounting, sign making, legal services.

- New block's franchise would,'t give author information, but they likely created fewer full-time jobs and use out-of-state vendors for most services.
- Tap incentives
- The franchise restaurant at read had a location in town 3 blocks from the new location,
- They moved because the city offered them a tax rebate to redevelop a blighted block
- In effect, the city paid the franchise t tear down a block that likely generated more revenue than the franchise
  tax

would ever generate, and thy can't even start collecting taxes from the new block for Zot years.

- Big box stores us, downtown businesses
- In author's town , a big box tore along the highway is the largest single taxpayer in the city.
- They have a large influence over politics.
- City built the infrastructure f. the big box store using large federal grants, but maintenance will be expensive,
- IF the big box store vacates the location, the replacement will likely be something that generates less tax revenue (e.g, warehouse, church), but the city stil bears the high mainbrace cost.
- Comparing the big boy location to downtown businesses, the

businesses collectively generate similar revenue but require less infrastructure to mashtsin.

- If one business closes, it's easy to replace it with a similar business.
- Value per acre
- The common way to evaluate a municipal project is to calculate return on investment
- Author advocates using value per acre as an approximation for return on investment.
- He claims it's lox faster to calculate and usually correlates with the result of a more rigorous ROI analysis.
- Comparing a Walmart in Asheville to a downtown building, the downtown building generates look more property day per acre

and 76% more sales tax.

- Urban} did a large study of value per acre in different cities across the US and found several trends
- Older neighborhoods outperform never neighborhoods (esp neighborhoods that formed pre - 1930 us. after
- 19501.
- Poorer neighborhoods generate more value per acre than wealthy neighborhoods.
- Arias' close to the ' 'are" of a neighborhood generate more value.
- Plan for budgeting maintenance
- Most cities prioritize maintenance based on age of infrastructure and how severely it needs maintenance.
- Most cities run at a deficit, so they can't really maintain all of their infrastructure.

- Author proposes that cities spend all of their maintenance budget obsessively maintaining area, with highest value per ace.
- Obsessive like Disney world maintains their parks,
- Rationale: Invest in areas that are profitable so that maintenance 13 sustainable,
- Residents will respond to public investment with private investment because they have more confidence the city will continue investing in them,
- Infrastructure will fail is low value per acre areas, causing these neighborhoods to contract.
- This is a calculated loss, as the cities have to forfeit some land to return to the point

where the tax base is enough to sustainably fund ongoing maintenance.

- Intensity jumps
- us cities often have jumps of "intensity"' for no apparent reason.
- e.g., a 20-story building will be next to a one-story building
- Thought experiment
- Three lots are in a row and are the same size
- 1.  Single family home worth $ rook.
- 2.  Vacant lot
- 3.  20 - story building worth $10 M
- What is the make of (2) 7.
- A slum property implies the

underlying property is worth around $1. 5M.

- The owner of the vacant lot would want to sell to another W-story developer for $1.5 M
- Trick question because it means the single family home must also be worth -$1, SM
- A developer can purchase the house, demolish it, then build a $10 M building for a profit.
- In reality, slum buildings exist next to $ wok homes, so how can that be?.
- Development is artificially limited by regulation.
- It's roughly the same regulatory difficulty to build a Z- story building as a 5-story building, so development is pushed to the extremes.

- Development can't follow -free market forces, so expensive build, appear seemingly at random, often due to corrypt connections between developers and regulators.
- Subsidiarity
- Subsidiarity is the idea that rules should be made by the lowest level of government capable of making the decision intelligently
- Ligi, should resident, be allowed to keep chickens in their backyard?
- Absurd for the federal government to make this decision,
- Decision only affects a few immediate neighbors around the house.
- Ideal is if the neighbors talk and make a decision amongst themselves, without a formal law,

- Next step up would be local government helps the neighbors reach a decision, but without a law.
- Next step up would be the lot.) town passing a law about backyard chickens,
- Who should decide if a regional transit line is built?
- Requires more context than a few neighbors, so this should happen at the city or state level
