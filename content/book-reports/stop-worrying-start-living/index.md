## What I Liked

* The stories are often hokey, but they make the lessons feel more relatable.

## What I Disliked

* All the excerpts from contributors sound suspiciously like Dale Carnegie.
* Lots of the stories were fluff that didn't resonate with me.
* A lot of the advice feels easier said than done.
  * e.g., deciding to just stop worrying about a problem once you've thought about it enough

## Key Takeaways

### Live in "Day-tight compartments"

* In a speech at Yale, Sir William Osler advised students to live in "day-tight compartments."
* Osler had recently traveled across the Atlantic on a ship that could create watertight seals between parts of the ship during emergencies.
* Osler said that students have a larger journey than that boat, so they need to shut out the past and future to focus on today.
* The best way to prepare for the future is by thinking about how to do excellent work today.
  * Osler didn't say to ignore the future entirely, just to avoid focusing too much on it.

### Formula for Solving Worry Situations

1. Figure out the worst-case scenario for the thing that worries you.
1. Find a way to accept that outcome, if it were to happen.
1. Devote your time to improving the outcome.

If you can accept the worst-case scenario, then anything above that is an improvement.

### The High Cost of Getting Even

* When you hold onto hatred of your enemies, you harm yourself more than you harm them.
  * It would delight your enemies to know that they occupy your thoughts.

Carnegie asked Dwight Eisenhower's son if his father ever held resentments:

>No, Dad never wastes a minute thinking about people he doesn't like.

No one can humiliate or disturb you unless you let them.

### Ignoring ingratitude

* People become obsessed with resentment when they feel like someone shows them too little gratitude for a gift or favor.
* It's natural for people to forget to show gratitude, so we shouldn't expect it.
  * Jesus cured 10 lepers, and only one said thank you, so we shouldn't expect more.
* We need to find joy in the act of giving rather relying on the recipient's gratitude.
* Gratitude is a learned trait, so if you want your children to be grateful, you must demonstrate gratitude.

### Would you take a million dollars for what you have?

Would you sell any of these things for a million dollars?

  * Your eyes
  * Your legs
  * Your hands
  * Your family
  * Your children

If not, you effectively have millions of dollars in assets for which to be thankful.

### Clear your desk

* To improve your focus and reduce stress, clear your desk of all papers except those related to the immediate problem at hand.
* Psycohologist William Sadler had a story about helping an executive manage stress at work.

>"Tell me," said the patient, "where do you keep your unfinished business?"
>
>"Finished!" said Sadler.
>
>"And where do you keep your unanswered mail?"
>
>"Answered!" Sadler told him. "My rule is never to lay down a letter until I have answered it. I dictate the reply to my secretary at once."

### Avoid deferring decisions

* Putting off hard decisions increases stress.
* When facing a hard problem, either make a decision with the information you have or make the decision to gather more information.
