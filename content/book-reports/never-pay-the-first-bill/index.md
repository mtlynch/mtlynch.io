## What I liked

- Got me fired up about exercising my rights as a patient.
- The biggest bang-for-buck technique I've learned is simply comparing my medical bill to the explanation of benefits from my insurer.
  - There have been five separate cases in the last six months where the provider billed beyond me above what they negotiated with my insurer or they told me a bill was 100% my responsibility and it turned out they never contacted my insurer at all, despite collecting my insurance information at the time of service.

## What I disliked

- The author doesn't have a good sense of which techniques are effective.
  - He sometimes says, "I've heard this works,"

## Key takeaways

### Things you can do to fight unfair medical bills

#### Compare your medical bill with your insurer's EOB

- Compare the bill you receive from your provider with the explanation of benefits (EOB) you receive from your insurer.
  - If the provider's bill lists a higher amount of patient responsibility than your insurer's EOB, show the EOB to the provider and tell them to send you a corrected bill.
  - Editor's note: This has been the most effective technique for me and has saved me $3k+ in the last six months.

####

- Verify the CPT codes on your bill.
  - If your provider didn't send an itemized bill with a CPT code for each charge, ask them for a version with CPT codes.
  - Search online for the CPT codes.

### Insurers want higher medical bills

- As a patient, you expect that your insurer's incentives are aligned with yours to prevent medical providers from overbilling you.
- In reality, there are several factors that incentivize insurance companies to drive medical prices higher.
  - The Affordable Care Act [set limits](https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/private-health-insurance/medical-loss-ratio) on how much insurers can profit from customer premiums, so insurers can't make more than 20% profit. This rule has the unintended consequence of benefitting insurance companies when medical costs go up nationwide.
    - e.g., if an insurer can only make 20% profit on $500M/yr in medical spending, then they make more profit in absolute terms if they allow providers to drive up medical spending to $700M/yr.
  - Insurers and providers often have intermingled businesses where the insurer that's supposed to be controlling costs [has the same owner as the company providing medical services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group#Organizational_structure).
  - In cases where the patient is responsible for the majority of the cost, the insurer has no reason to invest resources into fighting a medical provider, as the patient is the one who has to foot the bill.

### Medical bills have an extremely high error rate

- Some providers routinely "upcode" for services.
  - For example, if they spent 15 minutes with a patient, they'll bill using a code that says they spent 30 minutes.

### Audit the CPT codes on your bill

- Each charge on your bill requires a CPT code.
- Regular people don't have access to the CPT code definitions.

- Pay attention to:
  - How long did the provider spend with you

### Hospitals are required to publish pricing

- In practice, most hospitals ignore this rule
