*The Goal* is about deriving . It involves identifying the bottlenecks of a business and reorganizing processes until that bottlenecks is no longer the limiting factor. It sounds simple and perhaps obvious, but it helped me to think about my own business.

The book is a novel that teaches Goldratt's ideas through a fictional story. It makes the book a light, engaging read, but it also feels like a lot of fluff to teach a few simple concepts. I felt silly that the author was doing the equivalent of hiding vitamins in my oatmeal because I can't pay attention to a real nonfiction book. That said, the last chapter is pure lessons and no story, and I found it difficult to pay attention and get through it, so maybe I the novel format is what I need to stay engaged.

The story is funny in that it's the author's thinly veiled business fantasy. The protagonist is a struggling factory manager whose plant is about to fold. He's mostly helpless without the guidance of his friend, a mysterious and near-omniscient Israeli physicist-turned-business-consultant. The author, Eliyahu Goldratt, happens to be an Israeli physicist-turned-business-consultant.

## What I Liked

* I appreciated Goldratt's distinction between science and truth.
* The book feels like light read, and novel format makes it easy to get through and stay engaged.
* The Theory of Constraints helped me think about priorities in my business.
* I liked Goldratt's metrics for judging a business's success.

## What I Disliked

* The protagonist's marriage is a huge bummer.
  * He always prioritizes his job above his children and his marriage. The book makes his negligence out to be negative, but not very.
  * He does so little parenting or housework that his wife eventually leaves him.
  * I was expecting him to realize that he and his wife should have a discussion about dividing responsibilities rather than him constantly breaking commitments to his family for his job. Instead, after his wife leaves, his mother moves in and just takes over all the childcare and household chores.
* The protagonist meets an overweight child who struggles on a hike. Throughout the book, the protogonist casually refers to the child as "the fat kid" and uses him as the canonical example for a part of  the system that holds everyone else back.

## Key Takeaways

### Science is not truth

* Science is the process by which we create a minimum set of assumptions necessary to explain a phenomenon.

>The Law of Conservation of Energy of physics is not truth. It is just an assumption that is valid in explaining a tremendous amount of natural phenmoena. Such an assumption can never be proven since even an infinite number of phenmena that can be explained by it does not prove its universal application. On the other hand, it can be disproved by just a single phenomenon that cannot be explained by the assumption. This disproving does not detract from the validity of the assumption. It just highliughts the need or even the existence of another assumption that is *more* valid. This is the case with the assumption of the conservation of energy which was replaced by Einstein's more global &mdash; more valid &mdash postulation of the conservation of energy and mass. Einstein's assumption is not true to the same extent that the previous one was not "true."

* We've done too much gatekeeping around the label "science."
  * We think of science as a way to explain physics, math, and biology, but we should accept the study of businesses and organizations as real science as well.

### Basic characters and plot

*The Goal* explains non-fiction ideas through a fictional story, so it's hard to explain without giving some basics on the story itself.

* **Alex** is the manager of a ~100-person factory that manufactures some unspecified set of physical products.
* **Jonah** is an Israeli physicist-turned-business consultant. Alex studied under him in college and then runs into him many years later at the start of this story.

Alex's factory is underperforming and company executives are considering shutting down the entire factory. Jonah claims that Alex's problems result from blindly accepting conventional wisdom about business practices. Jonah begins advising Alex on how to approach his business scientifically from first principles.

### Local efficiencies are irrelevant

* Alex brags to Jonah that new robots in the factory lowered cost while improving efficiency by 30%.
  * Jonah asks if they shipped more products -> No.
  * Jonah asks if they fired anyone (reduced labor costs) -> No.
  * Jonah asks if they reduced inventory (reduced warehousing costs) -> No.
  * Jonah claims that these answers prove that the robots have not improved efficiency, as they failed to increase sales, reduce costs, or increase throughput.
* Jonah claims that all of Alex's metrics for measuring efficiency are incorrect.
  * Because everyone in the company uncritically accepts these metrics, nobody notices that the metrics don't align with the true goal of the company.
* Alex reviews his sales figures and inventory metrics and discovers that Jonah is right.
  * Robots had no impact on sales, and they increased inventory (decreased throughput).
  * Because the robots were so expensive, the company pressured the factory to run them at 100% capacity, even when there was no demand for the parts they produced.
    * The result was a huge increase in half-finished inventory.

### The goal

* The goal of any company is to make money.
* An activity is productive if it moves the company closer to its goal.
  * Any activity within a company must be measured in terms of whether it helps the company earn money.

### Metrics

* Three main metrics indicate whether a company is successful at making money.
  1. Net profit: How much the company earns in absolute dollar amounts.
  1. Return on investment: Net profit must be judged in the context of initial investment. A $10M profit is great for a $1M investment but a poor return for a $50B investment.
  1. Cash flow: Even with healthy profits and return on investment, a business can go bankrupt if its cash flow is poor.

* Jonah suggests the following metrics, which express equivalent ideas but are more practical to measure:
  1. Throughput: the rate at which the system generates money through sales.
  1. Inventory: all the money the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell.
  1. Operational expense: all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput.

### The myth of the balanced plant

* Every factory strives to be perfectly "balanced."
  * Where "balanced" means that the capacity for every resource perfectly matches market demand.
  * Every employee and machine is busy all the time, and there's a customer ready to purchase the finished product as soon as it leaves the factory.
* A balanced plant is unattainable in practice.
* A plant with zero idle time is inefficient because it means people must be working on products faster than the rate the company can sell them.
  * They're optimizing for local efficiencies rather than optimizing for what will most improve the company's bottom line.
* If you perfectly match capacity to demand, productivity will decrease.
  * This is due to two factors:
    1. Dependent events: Manufacturing a product involves multiple steps that depend on earlier processes.
    1. Statistical fluctuations: There's always random variance in the time it takes for any particular step in a pipeline.
  * Example:
    * A product passes through five departments for a task that takes, on average, an hour in each department.
    * Due to statistical variance, some departements will finish their work in a little more than an hour, and some will be a little faster than an hour.
    * If batches of products go through this pipeline, backups will form because delays in one stage impact all subsequent stages. Finishing early has no benefit unless the next department is ready to process the incoming batch immediately.

### Dependencies and fluctuations: hiking single-file

* Alex leads a Boy Scout troop on a hike and observes dependent events and statistical events in the boys' pace.
* The path is narrow, so everyone has to walk single-file.
* Even though most boys can walk ~2 mph, the group moves slower than that.
* One heavyset boy is slower than the rest and begins falling behind.
* Alex realizes that the average pace doesn't matter, because the slowest team member sets the pace of the group.
* The line of boys has dependent events and statistical fluctuations.
  * Statistical fluctuations: Boys don't walk a constant speed, but rather a mixture of faster and slower paces about 2 mph.
  * Dependent events: You can't move faster than the person ahead of you in line, so your speed is limited by theirs.
* Solution: The troop discovers the slowest boy is carrying a ton of excess weight in his pack, so they divide it up. The boy can now move much faster, which means the troop overall moves faster.
