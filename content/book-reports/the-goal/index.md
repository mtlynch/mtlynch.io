TODO: Short summary


<!--more-->

It's a business parable, so even though it's meant to teach about business, it's told in the format of a novel. It reminded me of [*Built to Sell*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781591845829) and [*The Five Dysfunctions of a Team*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780787960759).

The novel format is a double-edged sword. It makes it a light, engaging read, but it also feels like a lot of fluff to teach a few simple concepts. It makes me feel silly that the author feels like I can't pay attention to a real nonfiction book, so he has to spoonfeed me the information through this hokey novel. That said, the last chapter is pure lessons and no story, and I found it difficult to pay attention and get through it, so maybe I need the novel format.

The story is funny in that it's kind of shamelessly self-aggrandizing. It's about a struggling factory manager who meets a nearly omniscient, amazing Israeli physicist-turned-business-consultant. The author, Eliyahu Goldratt, happens to be an Israeli physicist-turned-business-consultant.

## What I Liked

* I appreciated Goldratt's distinction between science and truth.
* The book feels like light read, and novel format makes it easy to get through and stay engaged.
* The Theory of Constraints helped me think about priorities in my business.
* I liked Goldratt's metrics for judging a business's success.

## What I Disliked

* The protagonist's marriage is a huge bummer.
  * He always prioritizes his job above his children and his marriage. The book makes his negligence out to be negative, but not very.
  * He does so little parenting or housework that his wife eventually leaves him.
  * I was expecting him to realize that he and his wife should have a discussion about dividing responsibilities rather than him constantly breaking commitments to his family for his job. Instead, after his wife leaves, his mother moves in and just takes over all the childcare and household chores.
* The protagonist meets an overweight child who struggles on a hike. Throughout the book, the protogonist casually refers to the child as "the fat kid" and uses him as the canonical example for a part of  the system that holds everyone else back.
