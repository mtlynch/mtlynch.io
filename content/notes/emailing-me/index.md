title: "Increase Your Reply Rate on Cold Emails to Me"

Emailing someone who you've never spoken to before is called a "cold email."

There are lots of guides on writing cold emails. This one is a bit niche, as it's about cold emailing a single person: me. But I guarantee you that it's the best guide you can find on this specific topic.

I'm publishing my guidelines under the [Creative Commons BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), so you're welcome to reuse or adapt them to guide people in emailing you.

## I know this sounds obnoxious

Every time I see someone post a guide about how other people should interact with them, I roll my eyes and privately judge that person for being self-important.

But I also get a lot of emails from people who spent 20+ minutes writing something that would never get a response from me.

I do enjoy getting emails from readers. I'm not famous enough that I'm inundated with emails. I receive maybe 10 per month, and I respond to a handful depending on how busy I am.

## Things that increase my chances of responding

### Your email benefits me in some way

I know this sounds selfish, but this is true.

Note that helping people is something I enjoy, so

- Offers an improvement on something I've written about.
- Offers a solution to a problem I've written about.

### You're also a bootstrapped founder

Meaning you've tried to run a business, not that you've idly thought about it a lot.

You don't have to be a successful founder. If you've had 20 flops, that's more interesting to me than someone who just put up a landing page yesterday.

I'm 100x more likely to respond if you've tried

### You write publicly

You have a blog or you've published books. It doesn't have to be a popular blog or a beautiful blog or even a good blog. As long as you're writing with your human mind and human hands, I'm interested.

YouTube counts, Twitter doesn't.

### We've done something similar

- e.g., worked at the same place, lived in the same city, drank from the same water bottle.

## Things that decrease my chances of responding

### You're immediately asking me to meet with you

I'm an introvert, and I spend most of my time writing or coding. So if I meet with someone, even on a short video call, it seems like it might be asking only 30 minutes of my day, but it's more like 90 minutes because of the way it impacts my schedule.

I do sometimes meet with people who cold email me, but it's usually when there's some opportunity for us to work together or there's an obvious way we can help each other on a live call.

### You're asking something I've already answered in my blog

If you're asking a question, first try searching the topic on a search engine and append `site:mtlynch.io`. You might get your answer instantly, and we'd both save time.

I don't expect you to read every last word of my blog to know everything I've ever said. But just try to read the big stuff.

So if you ask me if I have any thoughts about code reviews and it seems like you haven't read anything I've written, I'll quickly archive that email.

But if you ask me something about how I use Docker, I don't expect you to read every post where I mention Docker to see if I've answered your question.

### Your email looks templated

If you just say, "I read your blog, and I really enjoy your writing," it might be a sincere sentiment, but it's also what 99% of spam I receive looks like, so I might mistake you for a bot.

If you're reaching out because something I wrote resonated with you, that's great! But just be a bit more specific about what you liked and why.

### Your email looks AI-generated

We're probably in the last few years where I can meaningfully distinguish a human-written email from an AI-generated email, but while we're still here, try to make your email as human-sounding as possible. If it sounds like something an AI chatbot would generate, try revising it to sound more like you.

### You include a lot of details that need addressing

The easiest emails for me to respond to are when someone says they liked one of my posts. It brightens my day, and I can send a quick thank you.

When people include a lot of extra details, it makes it hard to give a quick thanks. Here's a made up example:

> Thanks for your post about unit testing! It taught me a lot.
>
> That post really brightened my day because things are a bit gloomy on the farm where I live. Grandma Pauline has come down with smallpox again, and we've had to say goodbye to our beloved hamster, Emilio, due to the global pellet supply crisis.

I'd like to say thanks to an email like that, but I also don't want to just ignore your grandma's illness or your hamster tragedy, so I'll probably just keep putting it off and then eventually archive it.

### You insert trackers into your email

If you use an email service that injects hidden pixels or you use special links that track when I've clicked, I'm a lot less likely to respond.

I understand that it's interesting to know who read and clicked your email, but it's also invasive and sneaky to put hidden trackers in your email.

## Things that I definitely won't respond to

### Private tech support

If you're emailing about an open-source project I've published, make sure you recognize that open-source authors [are not obligated to help you](https://mikemcquaid.com/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/). If anything, you owe them a favor because they created something that you use.

If you need help with one of my projects on GitHub or GitLab, file an issue there. If the project is archived or doesn't offer a way to request support, I don't support that project anymore.

If you have a question about a blog post that doesn't have an accompanying source code repo, I'm more likely to respond if you instead leave your question as a comment on the relevant post. That way, if I respond to you, everyone else benefits. Also, someoene else may respond to you if I don't have time.

### A job offer

I love working for myself, so it's nearly impossible that I'm interested in having an employer again.

If you're really intent on offering me a job, this is basically the only intro that might get a positive response:

> I'm going to pay you $1,000 in advance just to get on a call with me, and the salary is $1M/year in salary, excluding equity or options.
