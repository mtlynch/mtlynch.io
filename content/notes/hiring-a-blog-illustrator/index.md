## Background

I'm a blogger, and I often commission custom illustrations for my blog posts. My [annual review posts](/tags/annual-review/) are a good showcase of

I worked with an illustrator for six years and I loved working with her, but she changed careers earlier this year. I'm looking for someone who can take over as the blog's official illustrator.

## Benefits

- Long-term client relationship
- Wide variety of subjects
- Room to bring your own creativity and style
- Competitive pay
- Your work will be featured with credit on a popular technology blog
  - My blog receives 250k-450k unique readers annually.

## What it's like working with me

I value communication.

Everything is asynchronous.

## Working process

1. I create a written spec
   - Examples
1. You show me an initial sketch
1. I give notes about the draft
1. You show me a revision
1. We repeat steps 3 and 4 until the piece is complete (usually two to four rounds of feedback total)

I wrote about this process in [a previous blog post](/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/#the-process-end-to-end)

## What style I'm looking for

My previous illustrator had a distinctive style that I liked, but I don't want you to just mimic the existing style. I'd like you to bring your own style to the work.

The words I'd like readers to think of when they read my blog are:

- Lighthearted
- Knowledgeable
- Funny
- Trustworthy
- Doesn't take itself too seriously

## Pay structure

I pay by the hour rather than a flat fee per article or per illustration.

### Why not pay a flat fee for every illustration?

The problem with paying a flat fee for every illustration is that if I want a more elaborate illustration sometimes, then the artist is getting underpaid. It also discourages me from requesting a set of simple, quick illustrations if I'm paying the same fee regardless of complexity.

### Why not pay a flat fee on a per-illustration basis?

If we have to decide on a fee on a per-illustration basis, we both end up spending a lot of our time thinking about price instead of just working.

## Pay rate

I'll pay you your hourly rate, but I'm aiming to pay roughly $75 per illustration.

If you charge $80/hr and each illustration takes you three hours, it's probably not going to work.

If you charge $50/hr and each illustration takes you about 90 minutes, that would work great. It also works fine if you charge $25/hr and each illustration takes three hours. You get how math works.

Keep in mind that your illustrations don't have to be as detailed as what's currently on the blog. I'd be fine with a simpler style if that allows us to hit a $75/illustration target.

## Payment

I'll pay your invoice for work when each set of illustrations is complete. Expect payment within five business days of the invoice, usually sooner.

I don't pay bonuses or tips. I want your compensation to be transparent, so you don't have to wonder about undefined pay left to my discretion.

I pay via PayPal, Payoneer, ACH transfer (US only), or a mailed check (US only), depending on your preference. If you have an invoicing service that takes online payments, I'm happy to pay that way.

## Credit

Your name and link will appear at the bottom of the page. You won't be able to include a signature in the images themselves.

## Hiring process

I will shortlist the applications to 3-5 candidates.

I'll give each candidate a paid trial job at your normal hourly rate, capped to five hours of work.

At the end, I'll pick the candidate that's the strongest fit. I will pay you for the work in the trial even if I choose not to move forward with you.

## How to apply

Please don't email outside of the application link because it makes it hard for me to keep track of applicants that way.
