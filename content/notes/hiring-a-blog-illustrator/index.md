## Background

I commission custom illustrations for many of my blog posts.

## Benefits

- Long-term client relationship
- Competitive pay
- Your work will be featured with credit on a popular technology blog
  - My blog receives 250-450k unique readers annually.
  - I will include your name and a link at the bottom of each post you illustrate.

## Testimonials

TODO

## Style

I'm not looking for someone to mimic the style of the existing illustrations.

Lighthearted, funny, trustworthy, knowledgeable, doesn't take itself too seriously.

## Pay structure

I pay by the hour rather than a flat fee per article or per illustration.

The problem with paying a flat fee for every illustration is that if I want a more elaborate illustration sometimes, then the artist is getting underpaid. It also discourages me from requesting a set of simple, quick illustrations if I'm paying the same fee regardless of complexity.

If we have to decide on a fee on a per-illustration basis, we both end up spending a lot of our time thinking about price instead of just working.

## Pay rate

I'll pay you your hourly rate.

I'm aiming to pay around $75 per illustration on average.

## Payment methods

## Hiring process

I will shortlist the applications to 3-5 candidates.

I'll give each candidate a paid trial job at your normal hourly rate, capped to five hours of work.

At the end, I'll pick the candidate that's the strongest fit. I will pay you for the work in the trial even if I choose not to move forward with you.

## How to apply

Please don't email outside of the application link because it makes it hard for me to keep track of applicants that way.

### Questions

- Why would you be a good fit for this job?
