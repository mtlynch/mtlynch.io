Last week, I stumbled upon a reddit post announcing that the author, Charles Marohn, was giving a free talk near my town the next morning. Marohn is the author of [_Strong Towns_](/book-reports/strong-towns/), one of my favorite books of the last few years. So, my wife and I attended the talk and enjoyed it.

The talk is based on ideas from Marohn's new book, [_Escaping the Housing Trap_](https://www.housingtrap.org/), which I haven't read yet, so these notes are from memory.

## Takeaways

### There's broad agreement that there's a housing crisis in the US

- Most people agree that there is a housing crisis.
  - Housing has become so expensive that most middle class Americans have trouble affording housing.
- People disagree about how to solve the crisis.

### Contradictory solutions to housing crisis

#### Solution 1: Housing prices should fall

- Pro: Housing becomes affordable for more Americans.
- Con: Falls in housing prices historically have had catastrophic effects on the economy.
  - Mortgages go underwater, so people stop paying.
  - Banks fold because they can't collect mortgage payments.

#### Solution 2: Housing prices should increase

- Pro: Increased home values is associated with neighborhood prosperity.
- Con: As prices increase, fewer Americans can afford homes.

### History of mortgages

- Pre-1920, home mortgages used to be hyper-local.
  - You'd get a mortgage from a local community bank.
  - The community bank has all your neighbors' money, so it makes extremely conservative loans to minimize risk of insolvency (50% down payment, 3-5 year mortgages).
- After the Great Depression, the federal government made changes to help banks stay solvent and reduce home foreclosures.
  - They created the FDIC, which guaranteed bank balances for account holders.
  - They created Fannie Mae, which acted as a secondary market for mortgages (i.e., banks could sell off mortgage debt for cash).
- Housing prices have gone through multiple bubbles and bursts since 1920s.
- After every bubble burst, one of the primary tools the federal government uses to spur recovery is to make it easier for Americans to obtain mortgages.
  - e.g., government guarantees loans, government agrees to buy bad loans, government pushes banks to offer longer-term loans (15-year, then 30-year, now 40-year).

### Case-Shiller home price index

- The [Case-Shiller home price index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp_case_shiller_us_nhpi.asp) is an index of home prices in the US.
- Marohn showed a graph of the index going back to the early 1900s, but I can't find it anywhere online.
- In Marohn's graph, you can see clear cycles where home prices peak, then crash as a recession hits, then rise to new highs in response to government intervention.

### The problem with accessible mortgages

- The more the government intervenes to make loans accessible, the more mortgages become an instrument for banks and investors to profit off of homeowners.
  - Mortgages now serve investors' profits rather than helping Americans afford homes.
- Offering 30- or 40-year mortgages encourages homeowners to make irresponsible choices.
  - If someone can't afford a house with a 15-year mortgage, they shouldn't buy with a 30-year mortgage, either.
- Financing is available for high-end and mid-range home construction but very little at the low end.
  - It's difficult to obtain financing to build a 400 square foot house or to turn a single-family home into a duplex.
- Higher and higher loans are not sustainable.
  - They put Americans deeper in debt and encourage irresponsible purchases.

### Marohn's proposed solutions

- Reduce friction in permitting.
  - Someone should be able to walk into city hall with building plans at 9 AM and walk out with an approval to start building.
  - It's fine if big box stores still go through months of approvals, but single family homes should be near instant.
- Encourage starter homes.
  - Offer financing for building small homes.
  - Offer financing to let people build backyard cottages (aka in-law apartments / ADUs) if they have excess yard space.
- Make duplex to single conversions simpler.
  - A retiree living in a 4 bedroom house by themselves should be allowed to add a kitchenette and extra entrance and rent it out with minimal regulatory friction.
