# Naturally recurring market

- Ongoing actual costs
- Financial cycles
- Pain naturally changes over time
- Offering support

# Doesn't rely on virality

100 users, 1% invite a friend, means only 0 to 1 new user per month.

# Not a real-time business

- It's doesn't crush customers' businesses if it's down for a few hours.
  - If something goes down in the middle of the night, can it wait until morning?
- Hosting is a bad example.
  - "That was a mistake"
- Good examples:
  - Analytics, decision support
  - Finance - Finance folks have buffer around their time.
  - Project management - If Trello is down for an hour, you're probably not going to cancel your subscription.
  - Content - Can be down for a few hours, but it's also easy to make always available on a static site.

# Bad: Marketplace

# Something that can be "finished"

- WinZIP

# Good Market: Aftermarkets
