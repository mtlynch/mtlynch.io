Jason Cohen's 2013 Microconf talk, [_Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw), is one of the most valuable resources I've found for bootstrapped founders.

Below, I've included my notes

## [Most businesses don't work](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw)

- Most businesses fail.
  - Of those, most are building a product that customers don't actually want.
  - Some fail because they're building a product customers want but with a business structure that's incompatible with bootstrapping.

## [Jason's background](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=46)

- Founder of [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com), one of the most popular WordPress hosting vendors
- Founded four companies
  - All made over $1M/yr
  - All of them were profitable
  - Sold two of them
  - All bootstrapped, although WPEngine later raised venture capital

## [A "cash machine"](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=120)

- The ideal self-funded business is a "cash machine"
  - A predictable way to make profit every month
- 20% of people in the conference audience would make $10k the following month if they invested zero work into their business
- Goal of self-funded business should earn at least $10k/month in revenue per founder
  - More ideally like $20-40k/month
  - _\[**Ed**: He says "revenue" but I suspect he means "profit"\]_

## [Revenue model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202)

### [One-offs never get easier](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202)

- One-off sales never get easier
  - Every month, you restart at $0 in revenue
- One-off sales are the opposite of a cash machine
- Even when Jason Cohen's previous company (Smart Bear, one-off sales) reached millions in revenue per month, he still worried he'd fail to meet payroll every month.
  - The stress never went away

### [Recurring revenue: the only way](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=4m21s)

- The myth of "1,000 true fans"
  - Kevin Kelly [introduced the idea](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)
  - Musicians could gain indepedence from music labels if they could convince 1,000 passionate fans to buy $100-200 in merch and concerts or other purchases that go directly to the artist.
  - Seth Godin [popularized the idea](https://seths.blog/2008/03/1000-true-fans/)
  - Kevin Kelly got feedback from musicians that his idea wasn't practical and walked back the idea
  - It's difficult to get that many fans to give you recurring revenue
    - For musicians, $100-200k/yr is not enough to cover the costs of touring
- Better target: 150 customers
  - Should have 20-30 customers waiting to pay you monthly before you even start building
    - If you can't find 20-30 in the first few months, it's going to be hard to reach a sustainable customer base ever
  - First 50: Scratching and clawing your first customers
  - Next 25: Guest postings, social media
  - Next 75: Basic marketing

### [WPEngine's first customers](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=7m10s)

- Jason found 40 WordPress consultants on LinkedIn
- He said he had a new product designed to serve them
- **Key**: He offered to pay them to talk to him
  - Whatever they think is fair, even if it's higher than their normal hourly rate because it's a one-off job
- 100% agreed to speak with him on the phone
  - 38 actually scheduled calls
  - 0 asked for any money
- **Takeaway**: Showing that you value their time yields positive results

### [Pricing](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=9m30s)

- If the revenue goal is $10k/mo and the customer base is 150 customers, you need to charge each customer $66/mo, on average
  - $10k / 150 customers = $66.66/customer
- Most founders charge a lower rate because their service is crappy starting out
  - Everything is barebones, support is slow because it's just the founder
  - Founder decides to charge $19/mo because they assume their product isn't worth a higher rate
  - Lower price means you have to find more customers, difficult to do
- Strategies
  - Price tiers
    - WPEngine had three tiers segmented by customer type: $49 / $99 / $249
    - Average revenue per customer was over $100/mo
  - High prices, but lots of coupon opportunities
    - $99/mo, but give bloggers a 30% off coupon for their readers
    - Ends up being the $66/mo target

### [Boutique business](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=12m06s)

- Popular associates about a boutique business
  - Small
  - Not open very much because it has a small staff, usually just owners
  - Expensive
  - Customers receive lots of personal attention
  - Work is special and unique
  - Customers feel good supporting the business
- Present yourself to customers as "boutique"
  - Customers will tolerate higher prices if they think of it as supporting an independent boutique vendor

### [Cash flow](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=13m20s)

- Cash is king
- The "annual pre-pay trick"
  - "You have to do it." -Jason Cohen
  - Example marketing scenario
    - Spending $300 on Google Ads gets you $50/mo in recurring revenue
    - Therefore, spending $60k gets you $10k/mo in recurring revenue
      - _\[**Ed**: This is pretty far off because Google Ads have quickly diminishing returns\]_
    - You could reach your target monthly revenue right now if you had $60k in cash to spend
    - Tell customers they get two months free with an annual plan
    - You'd get $100k in cash immediately as opposed to $120k over the course of a year
    - After the $60k on Google Ads, you'd have $40k left over to spend immediately on marketing, design improvements, etc. rather than waiting to collect the recurring revenue over a year
- WPEngine's numbers
  - 1/4 of signups pre-pay for a year
    - 75% pay 1x month
    - 25% pay 10x month
    - 0.75 x 1 + 0.25 x 10 = 3.25
    - WPEngine gets 3.25x the cash flow as they would without annual pre-pay option
    - WPEngine's cost of customer acquisition is lower than their monthly cash flow, so they effectively have an infinite marketing budget
- Can combine annual pre-pay with coupons to make them more enticing
  - Coupon gives you three months free on annual plan
  - They would have gotten two without the coupon, but three sounds more exciting
- Adjust pricing
  - Can play with pricing so monthly price is higher, annual discount is steeper
  - Encourages customers to get you cash up front faster

### [Free trials](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=21m07s)

- Most people who sign up with a credit card will stay
- If they do the trial and don't convert, you lose money
- 60-day money back guarantee
  - Charge customers up front, but let them cancel easily
  - When WPEngine made this change, signups increased
    - Customers said it gave them more time to evaluate the product

### [No picking up pennies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=23m16s)

- Example: Kickstarter
  - Lots of money flowing through
  - Kickstarter "picks up pennies" by taking a small percentage
  - Raised $100M in funds, only $6M of the revenue went to Kickstarter
  - They finished the year at a loss and had to raise more money
  - Kickstarter is one of the most successful examples of this, and they have trouble turning a profit
- Cohen recommends against this model for bootstrapped businesses
  - "Go get customers, and charge them lots of money."

## [Market model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m05s)

- What markets are conducive to a cash machine company?

### [Only build B2B companies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m29s)

- Never sell to consumers
  - Cohen quoted an app store review that complained that a $1.99 app should have been priced at $0.99
    - Consumers are too price-sensitive and demanding
- Every Microconf speaker that year had a B2B business
  - Exception: patio11 with BingoCardCreator, but he recommends against B2C as well

### [Bad Market: Point-in-time / temporary pain](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=26m44s)

- Examples
  - Weddings
  - Events
  - Code profilers
- You have to catch customers at the exact right time
- For things like weddings, you're competing with tons of companies trying to market to brides/grooms in the months leading up to a wedding

### [Good Market: Naturally recurring market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=28m25s)

- Ongoing actual costs
  - Example: Server hosting
- Financial cycles
  - Example: taxes, invoicing, compliance
- Pain naturally changes over time
  - Example: digital marketing, SEO because the underlying market changes
- Offering support
  - Example: $100/mo for a premium support queue
    - "Free money" because you want to resolve all tickets anyway, but this changes the order

### [Bad Market: Viralityness](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=31m54s)

- Viral products almost never work
- 100 users, 1% invite a friend
  - Translation: Only 0 to 1 new user per month
- Only works when you have a large customer base
  - Expensive to build to that critical mass

### [Good Market: Not real-time](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=32m43s)

- If your product is down for a few hours, it doesn't impact your customers' business signficantly
  - If something goes down in the middle of the night, can it wait until morning?
- WPEngine (hosting) is a bad example
  - "That was a mistake"
  - Support staff has to wake up in the middle of the night to fix severe issues
- Examples
  - Analytics, decision support
  - Finance - Finance employees typically have a buffer around their timelines
  - Project management - If Trello is down for an hour, you're probably not going to cancel your subscription
  - Content - Can be down for a few hours, but it's also easy to make always available on a static site

### [Bad Market: Marketplaces](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=34m30s)

- Platform that matches buyers with sellers
- Examples
  - Etsy, Kickstarter, eBay
- Difficult to get off the ground
  - Have to attract sellers and offer the functionality they need
  - Have to attract buyers simultaneously
  - Costly to attract and support both
- You're effectively starting two highly risky companies
  - Both have to succeed in order for the business to be sustainable

### [Good Market: Something that can be "finished"](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=36m07s)

- Examples
  - WinZIP, Freshbooks, Basecamp, hosting, time-tracking, bug-tracking, CRM, wiki, task management, email, PDF editor, image editor, web analytics
- Don't want to get stuck in a feature war with a competitor
  - As a bootstrapper, you'll have fewer resources to build features, so you're at a disadvantage

### [Good Market: Aftermarkets](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=37m12s)

- An established product with a significant following, and you build add-ons or integrations
- Examples
  - Smart Bear: Added code review to Perforce and Subversion
  - Balsamiq: Started as add-ons to Basecamp
  - WooThemes: Themes for WooCommerce
  - AlienSkin: Make Photoshop plugins
  - QODBC: Makes ODBC interface for QuickBooks, allows customers to make database queries against it
- Ecosystems
  - Some ecosystems are friendlier than others to
    - Apple App Store: Semi-hostile to third-party apps, sometimes introduce competing first-party apps
    - Salesforce, Heroku
      - Committed not to compete with aftermarket vendors
      - They limit the features they implement themselves in order to foster an ecosystem of third-party tools
- Vendors are often interested in supporting you
  - Makes their product more valuable

### [Good Market: Big market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=40m10s)

- In a large market, many niches to inhabit
  - Risk that your niche is too small, but in a large market, easier to find adjacent niches
- Big market gives instant validation that the pain point exists and people are paying to solve it
- Big market gives you the option to grow from a lifestyle business to a billion dollar business if you want

## [Acquisition model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=42m40s)

### Ads > social media

- Jason doesn't like social media as a way of acquiring customers
- People underestimate the cost, overestimate the effectiveness of social media marketing
- Social media typically doesn't yield customers who want to pay a recurring price
- Jason Cohen's blog had 40,000 subscribers
  - Only two signed up when he launched WPEngine
- Hiten Shah observed a similar effect
  - Having a large following didn't translate to customers

### [How much to pay per click?](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=44m47s)

- Rule of thumb: Cost per click = Average monthly revenue per customer / 25
  - Example: $50/month in revenue, pay $2 per click
