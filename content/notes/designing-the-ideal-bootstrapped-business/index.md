Jason Cohen's 2013 Microconf talk, [_Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw), is one of the most valuable resources I've found for bootstrapped founders. I watched it for the first time [in 2020](/solo-developer-year-3/#you-can-build-a-successful-business-without-being-available-247), and I've revisited it repeatedly since then.

If you're new to the world of bootstrapped software business, or you're struggling to gain traction with your business, I highly recommend this talk.

Below, I've included my notes.

{{<youtube id="otbnC2zE2rw" title="Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business">}}

## [Most businesses don't work](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw)

- Most businesses fail.
  - Most fail because they build a product that customers don't actually want.
  - Some fail because they're building a product customers want but with a business structure that's incompatible with bootstrapping.

## [Jason's background](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=46)

- Jason is founder of [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com), one of the most popular WordPress hosting vendors.
- Jason founded four companies.
  - All made over $1M/yr.
  - All of them were profitable.
  - Jason sold two of them.
  - All were bootstrapped, although WPEngine later raised venture capital.

## [A "cash machine"](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=120)

- The ideal self-funded business is a "cash machine."
  - The business has a predictable way to make profit every month.
- 20% of people in the conference audience would make $10k the following month if they invested zero work into their business.
- Goal of self-funded business should earn at least $10k/month in revenue per founder.
  - _\[**Ed**: He says "revenue" but I suspect he means "profit"\]_

## [Revenue model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202)

### [One-offs never get easier](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=202)

- One-off sales never get easier.
  - Every month, you start over with $0 in revenue.
- One-off sales are the opposite of a cash machine.
- Even when Jason Cohen's previous company (Smart Bear, one-off sales) reached millions in revenue per month, he still worried he'd fail to meet payroll every month.
  - The stress never went away.

### [Recurring revenue: the only way](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=4m21s)

- The myth of "1,000 true fans"
  - Kevin Kelly [introduced the idea](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) of 1,000 true fans
  - Musicians could gain indepedence from music labels if they could convince 1,000 passionate fans to buy $100-200 in merch and concerts or other purchases that go directly to the artist.
  - Seth Godin [popularized the idea](https://seths.blog/2008/03/1000-true-fans/) by sharing the blog post with a larger audience.
  - Kevin Kelly got feedback from musicians that his idea wasn't practical and walked back the idea.
    - It's difficult to get that many fans to give you recurring revenue.
    - For musicians, $100-200k/yr is not enough to cover the costs of touring.
  - Godin never acknowledged the retraction, so the myth persists.
- Better target: 150 customers
  - You should have 20-30 customers waiting to pay you monthly before you even start building.
    - If you can't find 20-30 in the first few months, it's going to be hard to reach a sustainable customer base ever.
  - First 50: Scratching and clawing your first customers
  - Next 25: Guest postings, social media
  - Next 75: Basic marketing

### [WPEngine's first customers](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=7m10s)

- Jason found 40 WordPress consultants on LinkedIn.
- He said he had a new product designed to serve them.
- **Key**: He offered to pay them to talk to him.
  - The pay was "whatever [they] thought was fair," even if it's higher than their normal hourly rate because it's a one-off job.
- 100% agreed to speak with him on the phone.
  - 38 actually scheduled calls.
  - 0 asked for any money.
- **Takeaway**: Showing that you value their time yields positive results.

### [Pricing](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=9m30s)

- If the revenue goal is $10k/mo and the customer base is 150 customers, you need to charge each customer $66/mo, on average.
  - $10k / 150 customers = $66/customer/mo.
- Most founders charge a lower rate because their service is crappy starting out.
  - Everything is barebones, support is slow because it's just the founder.
  - Founder decides to charge $19/mo because they assume their product isn't worth a higher rate.
  - Lower price means you have to find more customers, difficult to do.
- Strategies
  - Price tiers
    - WPEngine had three tiers segmented by customer type: $49 / $99 / $249
    - Average revenue per customer was over $100/mo.
  - High prices, but lots of coupon opportunities
    - Example: Standard rate is $99/mo, but give bloggers a 30% off coupon for their readers.
      - Ends up being the $66/mo target.

### [Boutique business](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=12m06s)

- What do you think when you hear the word "boutique?"
  - Small
  - Not open very much because it has a small staff, usually just owners
  - Expensive
  - Customers receive lots of personal attention
  - Work is special and unique
  - Customers feel good supporting the business
- Present yourself to customers as "boutique."
  - Customers will tolerate higher prices if they think of it as supporting an independent boutique vendor.

### [Cash flow](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=13m20s)

- Cash is king.
- The "annual pre-pay trick"
  - "You have to do it." -Jason Cohen
  - Example marketing scenario
    - Spending $300 on Google Ads gets you $50/mo in recurring revenue.
    - Therefore, spending $60k gets you $10k/mo in recurring revenue.
      - _\[**Ed**: I disagree with this point, as Google Ads don't scale linearly like this. Scaling your spending from $300 to $60k means you have to bid higher for each click to capture a greater share of the results. I think a more realistic scenario is that if you scale your Google Ad spend by 20x, you'd see 10-15x the conversions.\]_
    - You could reach your target monthly revenue right now if you had $60k in cash to spend.
    - Tell customers they get two months free with an annual plan.
    - You'd get $100k in cash immediately as opposed to $120k over the course of a year.
    - After the $60k on Google Ads, you'd have $40k left over to spend immediately on marketing, design improvements, etc. rather than waiting to collect the recurring revenue over a year.
- WPEngine's numbers
  - 1/4 of signups pre-pay for a year.
    - 75% pay 1x month
    - 25% pay 10x month
    - 0.75 x 1 + 0.25 x 10 = 3.25
    - Translation: WPEngine gets 3.25x the cash flow as they would without annual pre-pay option.
    - WPEngine's cost of customer acquisition is lower than their monthly cash flow, so they effectively have an infinite marketing budget
- You can combine annual pre-pay with coupons to make them more enticing.
  - Example: Coupon gives you three months free on annual plan.
    - They would have gotten two without the coupon, but three sounds more exciting.
- You can adjust pricing to make pre-payment more appealing.
  - Increase monthly price, and make annual discount steeper.

### [Free trials](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=21m07s)

- Most people who sign up with a credit card will stay.
- If they do the trial and never convert, you lose money.
- Instead, offer a 60-day money back guarantee.
  - Charge customers up front, but let them cancel easily.
  - When WPEngine made this change, signups increased.
    - Customers liked the change. They said it gave them more time to evaluate the product.

### [No picking up pennies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=23m16s)

- Example: Kickstarter
  - Lots of money flowing through.
  - Kickstarter "picks up pennies" by taking a small percentage.
  - Kickstarter raised $100M in funds, only $6M of the revenue went to Kickstarter.
  - They finished the year at a loss and had to raise more money.
  - Kickstarter is one of the most successful examples of this, and they have trouble turning a profit.
- Cohen recommends against this model for bootstrapped businesses.
  - "Go get customers, and charge them lots of money."

## [Market model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m05s)

- What markets are conducive to a cash machine company?

### [Only build B2B companies](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=24m29s)

- Never sell to consumers.
  - Cohen quoted an app store review that complained that a $1.99 app should have been priced at $0.99.
    - Consumers are too price-sensitive and demanding.
- Every Microconf speaker that year had a B2B business.
  - Exception: patio11 with BingoCardCreator, but he recommends against B2C as well.

### [Bad Market: Point-in-time / temporary pain](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=26m44s)

- Examples
  - Weddings
  - Events
  - Code profilers
- You have to catch customers at the exact right time.
- For things like weddings, you're competing with tons of companies trying to market to brides/grooms in the months leading up to a wedding.

### [Good Market: Naturally recurring market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=28m25s)

- Ongoing actual costs
  - Example: Server hosting
    - People know that servers are an ongoing cost, so they expect to pay for hosting on a recurring basis.
- Financial cycles
  - Example: taxes, invoicing, compliance
    - People have to do these things regularly.
- Pain naturally changes over time
  - Example: digital marketing, SEO
    - The underlying market changes, so the tools have to adapt.
- Offering support
  - Example: $100/mo for a premium support queue.
    - "Free money" because you want to resolve all tickets anyway, but this just changes the order that you process tickets.

### [Bad Market: Viralityness](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=31m54s)

- Viral products almost never work.
- If your viral coefficient is 1% per month (pretty good), and you have 100 users, that means you only get 0 or 1 new users per month.
- Viral products only work when you have a large customer base.
  - It's expensive to build to that critical mass.

### [Good Market: Not real-time](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=32m43s)

- A non-real time business is one where it's not a disaster if your product is down for a few hours.
- WPEngine (hosting) is a bad example, as any outage is a disaster.
  - "That was a mistake."
  - WPEngine's support staff has to wake up in the middle of the night to fix severe issues.
- Examples
  - Analytics, decision support
  - Finance - Finance employees typically have a buffer around their timelines
  - Project management - If Trello is down for an hour, you're probably not going to cancel your subscription
  - Content - Can be down for a few hours, but it's also easy to make always available on a static site

### [Bad Market: Marketplaces](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=34m30s)

- Platform that matches buyers with sellers
- Examples
  - Etsy, Kickstarter, eBay
- Difficult to get off the ground
  - You have to attract sellers and offer the functionality they need.
  - You have to attract buyers simultaneously.
  - It's costly to attract and support both.
- You're effectively starting two high-risk companies.
  - Both have to succeed in order for the marketplace to be sustainable.

### [Good Market: Something that can be "finished"](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=36m07s)

- Examples
  - WinZIP, Freshbooks, Basecamp, hosting, time-tracking, bug-tracking, CRM, wiki, task management, email, PDF editor, image editor, web analytics
- You don't want to get stuck in a feature war with a competitor.
  - As a bootstrapper, you'll have fewer resources to build features, so you're at a disadvantage.

### [Good Market: Aftermarkets](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=37m12s)

- Find an established product with a significant following, and build add-ons or integrations.
- Examples
  - Smart Bear: Added code review to Perforce and Subversion
  - Balsamiq: Started as add-ons to Basecamp
  - WooThemes: Themes for WooCommerce
  - AlienSkin: Paid plugins for Photoshop
  - QODBC: Makes ODBC interface for QuickBooks, allows customers to make database queries against it
- Ecosystems
  - Some ecosystems are friendlier than others to aftermarkets
    - Apple App Store
      - Apple is semi-hostile to third-party apps.
      - Apple sometimes introduces [first-party apps](https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/) to compete with third-party vendors on their platform.
    - Salesforce, Heroku
      - They're committed not to compete with aftermarket vendors.
      - They limit the features they implement themselves in order to foster an ecosystem of third-party tools.
- Vendors are often interested in supporting aftermarket vendors.
  - Aftermarks make their product more valuable.

### [Good Market: Big market](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=40m10s)

- In a large market, you have many niches to inhabit.
  - There's always a risk that your niche is too small, but in a large market, it's easier to find adjacent niches.
- Big market gives instant validation that the pain point exists and people are paying to solve it.
- Big market gives you the option to grow from a lifestyle business to a billion dollar business if you want.

## [Acquisition model](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=42m40s)

### Ads > social media

- Jason doesn't like social media as a way of acquiring customers.
- People underestimate the cost of social media marketing and overestimate its effectiveness.
- Social media typically doesn't yield customers who want to pay a recurring price.
- Jason Cohen's blog had 40,000 subscribers.
  - Only two signed up when he launched WPEngine.
  - Hiten Shah observed a similar effect.
    - Having a large following didn't translate to customers.

### [How much to pay per click?](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=44m47s)

- Rule of thumb: Cost per click = Average monthly revenue per customer / 25
  - Example: $50/month in revenue, pay $2 per click ($50 / 25 = $2)
  - The exact cost varies depending on your business.
  - The full derivation is [on Jason's blog](https://blog.asmartbear.com/bootstrapped-cpc.html).

## [The squeeze](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=45m40s)

- What happens if you successfully build a cash machine?
  - Your business will keep growing.
  - To sustain more customers, you need to hire more people.
  - Your job shifts from marketing and development to coding.
  - Do you still want to run a company like that?
- Paths forward
  - Sell before it's too big
    - You can arrange a sale with an earnout if the new owner doesn't have cash up front.
      - e.g., $20-30k/month for three years
  - Sell to partners
  - Sell to your biggest customer
  - Raise prices
  - Raise venture funding to grow even more
    - If you're willing to do venture capital, you should start with it rather than a slower start with bootstrapping

### [How to decide what to do next](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=50m49s)

- [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus) was Greek businessman-turned-philosopher.
  - When asked what is the hardest thing, he said "to know thyself."
- Understand what brings you fulfillment.
  - Understand that it changes over time.
- Talk to people who have been through this path before.

## [Summary](https://youtu.be/otbnC2zE2rw?t=52m17s)

Formula for success in a self-funded business:

- Predictable acquisition
- Recurring revenue
- Annual pre-pay
- Good market
