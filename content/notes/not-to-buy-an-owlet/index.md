title: "Why I Decided Not to Buy an Owlet Baby Monitor"

I recently became a new parent. I was talking to friends with kids that are a little older, and they mentioned that this product called "Owlet." It's a little sock that goes on your baby's foot and alerts you if the baby's heart rate or respiration drops to dangerous levels.

From hearing about the product, I had mixed feelings. It's comforting to get an immediate alert if there's something wrong with your baby, but it also feels like obsessive over-monitoring.

When I looked up the Owlet at home, I saw that it was $300, which felt pretty steep. I checked prices on used devices on eBay and found that they were available for as little as $50, which seemed much more reasonable. But then after a bit more research, I found out that they're priced so low because Owlet seems to have dropped support for all but the latest hardware version, leaving previous customers with degraded or maybe totally non-existent functionality.

I ultimately decided not to buy the Owlet and wanted to share what I discovered in researching the product.

## Reasons to buy the Owlet

### It might prevent a disaster

The nightmare scenario for me as a parent is that my son dies of something preventable while I'm sleeping or not monitoring him closely enough. So, there's definitely appeal in something that can alert me to a potentially fatal problem while it's early enough to intervene.

### It's non-invasive

From looking at photos, it seems pretty close to a sock, so it likely wouldn't bother our child if we bother it.

### It claims to have healthy sleep recommendations

The app claims to do some kind of pattern recognition in a baby's sleep pattern and makes recommendations for helping the baby have optimal sleep, which is appealing.

## Reasons to not buy the Owlet

### There aren't documented examples of Owlet saving lives

I think there are a lot of products that prey on parental anxiety, and I feel like Owlet is one of them.

It's $300 and a thing you have to constantly keep attached to your child, but what does that get you?

Owlet positions itself as preventing [SIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIDS), but I couldn't find any study showing that it's at all effective at doing that. The testimonials on the website are all about how parents feel more reassured, but there are no stories where the Owlet saved a life.

The NIH says of monitoring devices:

> Avoid using heart, breathing, motion, or other monitors to reduce the risk of SIDS. These types of monitors are not effective at detecting or preventing SIDS.

### Monitoring depends on Owlet servers being reachable

One of the wildest things I learned about Owlet is that their app stopped working entirely for all customers because of [a server outage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/parenting/owlet-baby-monitor.html). It's unclear from reporting whether alerts would fail in that outage window, but it sounds like they would, which is terrible for a device that presents itself as critical monitoring.

### Owlet aggressively drops software support for its products

As I mentioned, I

### The Android app has poor reviews

I looked through recent reviews for the Owlet app on the Google Play store and they seemed a mixture of very negative reviews and glowing-but-fake-sounding reviews.

Also, a product review I read (it was a fluffy affiliate review, so I'm not linkng) mentioned that Owlet actually requires customers _two different_ to install two different mobile apps.

Basically every hardware product I've ever used has an awful app. If the app is something you can't try out or meaningfully evaluate until you've already handed over your money, the company has no incentive to make it good. I don't really want something that's supposedly safety critical relying on some terrible mobile app.

### It has false negatives and false positives

In the [class action suit](https://www.classaction.org/blog/class-action-owlet-smart-sock-baby-monitors-give-false-alarms-fail-to-work-as-promised) against Owlet (more on that later), a customer reported getting two false alarms that caused her to call paramedics for her daughter only to find out nothing was wrong at all:

> The first named plaintiff in the suit says she received the Owlet Smart Sock 2 as a gift around August 2018. Within the first two weeks of using the product, it gave her two “red” alerts, the case says, which are the most “critical and immediate” of the Smart Sock alarms. The first alert reported low oxygen and the second showed both low oxygen and an abnormal heart rate, the suit says.
>
> After each alert, the plaintiff called 911, the case goes on, but the paramedics found her baby’s oxygen levels and heart rate to be within the normal range both times.

So, that's obviously undesirable, but I'd obviously have a false alarm than a false negative.

> Overdiagnosis occurs when the accurate detection of abnormalities fails to benefit the patient. This is because a single abnormal test—such as a self-resolving desaturation—can trigger a cascade of events. For example, a low pulse oximetry alarm from a consumer monitor could prompt an emergency department visit with blood tests, x-rays, and hospital admission. Rather than reassuring parents, these experiences may generate anxiety and a false assumption that their infant is at risk of dying. These considerations introduce the prospect that using a monitor could indirectly result in harm to infants and their families.

### Some parents report burns

In the product reviews and in the class action lawsuit, some parents report that their babies feet have received burns from this product.

### Owlet sells your baby's biometric data to advertisers

### Owlet solicits security reports from researchers but refuses to pay them

### It's expensive

## My conclusion

I decided not to buy the Owlet.

I might feel differently if my son had more risk factors for SIDS or if I was suffering from so much anxiety about his health that I couldn't sleep or relax, but I think my money and efforts are better spent elsewhere, like ensuring we're practicing [safe sleep hygiene](https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/reduce-risk/reduce).
