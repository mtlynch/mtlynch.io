I recently discovered that _Aardvark'd: 12 Weeks with Geeks_, the 2005 documentary about Fog Creek's internship program is [now available for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrkZ07LKbk).

At the time of this writing, it has 41 views, which is surprisingly low for a movie that features early interviews with many people who would go on to much greater fame and success, such as:

- Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor (StackOverflow, Trello, Glitch founders)
- Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston (Y Combinator founders)
- Aaron Swartz, Steve Huffman, and Alexis Ohanian (reddit founders)

## My history with this movie

I discovered Joel Spolsky's blog in college. I would grow to appreciate Joel's writing even more throughout my career, but in college, I already liked it.

I remember when Joel would advertise internships for college interns, and I felt like I wasn't good enough, so I was too scared to apply.

I remember reading about Joel making a documentary about his 2005 summer internship class, and I was always curious about it, but never watched it. In college, I wasn't that excited to feel inferior watching a bunch of people my age work my dream internship. About 10 years later, I remembered it again, but I couldn't find copies anywhere. Every few years, I check eBay to see if there are DVD copies floating around, but I've never found one for a reasonable price.

And then one day, I searched and found that it's on YouTube. Not some bootleg copy either. The original production studio published it in HD. I was curious enough and finally watched it.

As a documentary, it's mediocre, but as a time capsule of independent tech industry in 2005, it's great!

## What was going on in 2005?

The most enjoyable part is that it's an interesting time capsule

### Fog Creek Software

At the time of the documentary, Joel was 40 years old. He had co-founded Fog Creek XX years prior. Fog Creek only had XX employees. Fog Creek was profitable and Joel was one of the most popular software bloggers in the world, but Fog Creek wasn't making crazy money. This was still before Joel's mega-hit products like StackOverflow (year XX) or Trello (year XX).

Joel is presenting at a "trade show" which turns out to be a ColdFusion conference. The interns admit they don't know what ColdFusion is.

### Y Combinator

Paul Graham is 41 years old. He had sold his startup, Viaweb, to Yahoo for $50M in 1998, then he became popular for the essays he published on his blog. Jessica Livingston is 34 years old. She was not active in the startup community at the time, having come from a career in marketing.

{{<img src="paul-jessica.webp" max-width="600px" caption="Y Combinator co-cofounders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston in 2005">}}

Paul and Jessica [had been dating for two years](http://paulgraham.com/worked.html) but weren't married yet. They had co-founded Y Combinator together with two others a few months before. They were in the middle of YC's first batch of companies, which included a then-unknown project called reddit.

### reddit

reddit had launched a few months before the documentary began filming, and it was not at all on anyone's radar. At the time, you could only post links. There was no commenting feature. Digg was the dominant player in this domain.

{{<img src="reddit-2005.webp" max-width="600px" has-border="true" caption="The reddit homepage [in 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050804002153/http://www.reddit.com/)">}}

College roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian drove to Boston to attend one of Paul Graham's lectures in 2005. After graduating a few months later, they applied to Y Combinator and got accepted with reddit.

not at all relevant yet as a social networking platform. Digg was still the dominant

## Amateurish documentary filmmaking

On a technical level, _Aardvark'd_ seemed like it was made by someone who didn't have much experience filming anything. The interviews are uncomfortably close to people's faces, often with harsh lighting and mediocre sound quality.

{{<img src="joel-lighting.webp" max-width="600px" caption="I don't think Joel Spolsky is this luminsecent in real life">}}

Beyond the technical weaknesses, the documentary feels unfocused. Is it a story about the intern project or the interns themselves? Or is it a story about Fog Creek in general? Or is it about tech culture in the mid-2000s?

The film flits from topic to topic, but it never feels like it quite tells a cohesive story.

The total runtime is a short 78 minutes, but there still manages to be a lot of dead air. They keep interviewing a programmer at the Fog Creek office about his tomato plant, and it has no relevance to anything. They also do bizarre reenactments of things that didn't matter in the first place, like two of the interns finding a cockroach and getting scared.

{{<img src="cockroach-reenactment.webp" max-width="600px" caption="The movie features several strange re-enactments of events that are totally irrelevant">}}

## The launch day scene

There's one scene in particular that drove me crazy.

It's the end of the internship, and Fog Creek is finally launching Copilot. They have a betting pool with predictions about when they'll make their first sale. Some guessed it would happen within XX minutes of launch, others thought it might take up to XX hours.

{{<img src="sale-predictions.webp" max-width="600px">}}

But the sale doesn't come. One by one, you see them cross off people's predictions about when they'd get that first sale. You see the team worried that this thing they expected to be a big hit maybe will be a complete flop.

{{<gallery caption="Fog Creek interns forlornly waiting for the first customer to purchase Copilot">}}
{{<img src="cross-off.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{<img src="waiting.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{</gallery>}}

As a founder, I found this moment extremely relatable. There have been so many times where I put weeks or months of work into something with the expectation that people will love it, and then I discover after I launching that it was a complete miss.

I think the documentary does a great job of capturing that anxiety &mdash; that moment where you haven't definitely failed, but every minute that ticks by without a sale makes it more likely that you've made a big mistake. I've talked about it with other founders, but I've never seen it captured in real time.

The problem is that _Aardvark'd_ builds excellent tension in that scene and then seemingly forgets what it was doing and just moves on. The next scene is Joel popping champagne later that day, but it's not even clear if there's been a sale or if they're just celebrating the launch. You never see anyone's sighing in relief or admitting defeat.

It would be like if you ended the story of Little Red Riding Hood by saying, "And then Little Red Riding Hood realized her grandmother was a wolf! Suddenly, the wolf threw her to the floor and bared his razor-sharp teeth inches from her neck. Anyway, she ended up being fine. The End."

## What the documentary did well

I think it was relatable, especially because I was a college student at the same time. I felt like it was an accurate picture of culture at young tech firms of that era.

One thing I thought it captured really well was the self-important intern. In _Aardvark'd_, one of the Fog Creek interns speaks very seriously to the camera about how he has to stay grounded because one day, Fog Creek is going to be so big, and he so important within Fog Creek, that people will pass him in the hallway and greet him by name, but he won't know who they are.

It reminded me a lot of a guy in my computer science program who told me how much responsibility he was given at his fancy finance internship. He said he was so because once you're in, they'd always take care of you. This was in 2007, and the finance firm he was talking about was [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lehman_Brothers&oldid=1165023032#Bankruptcy).

There's a funny moment later on, when that same intern, after spending most of the film thinking he's the smartest guy in the room, realizes a showstopper bug was his fault.

## "Back when they were getting started, they were terrified"

There's a voice over from Jessica Livingston that summarizes my favorite part of the documentary.

> A lot of these tech startup founders who are extremely successful, back when they were getting started, they were terrified.
>
> They were very unsure of what they were doing. They questioned things, and I'm sure doubted themselves...
>
> And so to see these people as vulnerable people at one point in time is interesting to me.

spez is now the widespread target of ire for greedily cutting third party clients out of the platform they helped build.

In 2005, he was a lovably doofy-looking kid who had such bad nightmares about reddit having an outage that he had to sleep with his laptop in bed with him.

## Joel is not big on praise

Joel Spolsky surprisingly stingy with praise. In the penultimate scene, XX comes to Joel's office to announce he successfully got an article about Fog Creek scheduled for publication in _Crain's_. Joel Spolsky simply says, "Cool," without even turning from his computer screen.

The final line of the documentary is:

> We hire people who are really, really brilliant individually and do incredible work. But that's sort of what we expect of them
>
> I don't really feel like it's necessary to puff up their ego too much by saying, "Wow, you did an unbelievable, great thing! Nobody else could have done this."
>
> What I really want to say is, "That's what we expected."

## Fog Creek didn't finance it

I had always thought that Fog Creek fully funded this documentary, but reading the [job posting](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/03/23/documentary-filmmaker-wanted/), I realized they specifically didn't fund it.

It was more of an angel investor model:

> We’re looking for a filmmaker who will finance and make the film themselves and own the rights. We want someone who can promote the film to typical documentary outlets...

He said in his blog that he paid the filmmaker $5k stipend and $5k for expenses, but a later column he wrote for _Inc_ says, "We ended up paying the filmmaker about $30,000."

It's an interesting choice, and I guess it worked. Fog Creek has let a lot of the original links around Copilot die, but the filmmaker still cared enough to upload a high-def copy to YouTube 18 years later.

> This is not that big a deal. The code will be highly optimized for our own use and will require the reflector to work, which will not be released under GPL.

On CSS:

> We will use CSS for formatting but not positioning since CSS positioning is too buggy on modern browsers: we’ll just use tables for most positioning.

Uses "Apps Hungarian" (also known as "Simonyi notation"), which Joel was a big proponent of.

Uses apps simonyl style, a style Joel strongly supported. Joel admits that coding conventions "doesn't belong in a functional specification, and it should really have been a separate document."

They did release the code, but I unfortunately couldn't find the original version the interns wrote. The earliest version I could find was from 2011, at which point the code had been rewritten from C# to C++. I suspect that was part of the [Copilot 2.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/01/26/copilot-20-ships/), as that's when they added Mac support, and they probably didn't feel like running .NET on Mac.

## _Make Better Software: The Training Series_

Five years later, Fog Creek collaborated once again with Boondoggle Media on a video course called [_Make Better Software: The Training Series_](https://boondogglemedia.com/project/make-better-software/). Fog Creek [used to sell this course](https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014829/http://training.fogcreek.com/order.html) for $2000, but now Boondoggle Media has released it [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcIkt5s7w8D0ywp0CBmNFWRTFZic3pWNn).

I'm watching it, and it's pretty good. It's kind of like a video version of Joel Spolsky's most famous blog posts, and they show how they put those ideas into practice at Fog Creek.

## Where are they now?

### The interns

#### Tyler Griffin Hicks-Wright

In 2012, Tyler left Fog Creek and launched a photo backup business called Snaposit. The company applied for funding from Y Combinator, but Tyler was rejected by his _Aardvark'd_ co-star, Paul Graham and [shuttered the business a year later](https://tghw.com/blog/well-that-sucks-what-else-you-got).

In 2014, Fog Creek restructured to spin out Trello in 2014, Tyler [acquired the Copilot product for an undisclosed sum](https://tghw.com/blog/copilot-coming-full-circle). He ran it on the side for eight years before [shutting it down in April 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31192812).

At the time of the shutdown notice, people assumed Tyler was shutting down the company to sell the copilot.com domain Github, who had recently launched a well-known product called Copilot. Surprisingly, the buyer wasn't Github but rather a company that makes CRM software for service businesses.

According to his LinkedIn, after completing his undergrad at Rose Hulman, he started at Microsoft in 2006. I started a year later. He left in 2011 to join Firebase as employee #2. When Google acquired Firebase in 2014, Michael and I both worked at Google at the same time, though I don't recall ever crossing paths.

We have a mutual friend, and I'm surprised it's just one given so much employer overlap.

#### Ben Pollack

Ben acknowledges the _Aardvark'd_ documentary [on his website](https://www.bitquabit.com/meta/about/), saying:
