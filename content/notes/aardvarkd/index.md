- Dan Bricklin
- Dated in terms of gender
  - Help your mom use her computer
- Interns inflated sense of importance
  - Talking about one day, he's going to pass people in the hallway who say hi to him and he doesn't know who they are.
- Dislike
  - Way too much time on dumb stuff
  - Audio is bad
  - People are overexposed and shot from weirdly close

## As a documentary, it's not very good

## What was going on in 2005?

The most enjoyable part is that it's an interesting time capsule

### Fog Creek Software

not actually financed by Fog Creek

At the time of the documentary, Joel was 40 years old. He had co-founded Fog Creek XX years prior. Fog Creek was profitable and Joel was one of the most popular software bloggers in the world, but Fog Creek wasn't making crazy money. Joel hadn't yet co-created StackOverflow or Trello.

Joel is presenting at a "trade show" which turns out to be a ColdFusion conference. The interns admit they don't know what ColdFusion is.

### Y Combinator

Paul Graham is XX years old. He had sold Viaweb to XX XX years prior.

Jessica Livingston is XX years old.

At the time of the documentary,

Jessica Livingston captures why it was interesting - seeing founders when they're vulnerable.

### Reddit

spez is now the widespread target of ire for greedily cutting third party clients out of the platform they helped build. But in 2005, he was a lovably doofy-looking kid who had such bad nightmares about reddit having an outage that he slept in bed with his laptop.

## Joel liked it, apparently

One of the most surprising parts of the documentary is that Joel Spolsky, someone who cares a lot about product quality, thinks _Aardvark'd_ was a good documentary. TODO: Link to part where he says it was good.

[_Make Better Software: The Training Series_](https://boondogglemedia.com/project/make-better-software/) released in 2010. Fog Creek [used to sell this package](https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014829/http://training.fogcreek.com/order.html) for $2000, but now Boondoggle Media has released it [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcIkt5s7w8D0ywp0CBmNFWRTFZic3pWNn).

> VNC is GPL. The two components we’re building based on VNC, the helper and victim, will need to bere-released under GPL.

> This is not that big a deal. The code will be highly optimized for our own use and will require the reflector to work, which will not be released under GPL.

> We will use CSS for formatting but not positioning since CSS positioning is too buggy on modern browsers: we’ll just use tables for most positioning.

Uses apps simonyl style, a style Joel strongly supported. Joel admits that coding conventions shouldn't have been in the doc

They did release the code, but I unfortunately couldn't find the original version the interns wrote. The earliest version I could find was from 2011, at which point the code had been rewritten from C# to C++. I suspect that was part of the [Copilot 2.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/01/26/copilot-20-ships/), as that's when they added Mac support, and they probably didn't feel like running .NET on Mac.
