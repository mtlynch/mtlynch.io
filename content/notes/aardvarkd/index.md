## What was going on in 2005?

The most enjoyable part is that it's an interesting time capsule

### Fog Creek Software

not actually financed by Fog Creek

At the time of the documentary, Joel was 40 years old. He had co-founded Fog Creek XX years prior. Fog Creek was profitable and Joel was one of the most popular software bloggers in the world, but Fog Creek wasn't making crazy money. Joel hadn't yet co-created StackOverflow or Trello.

Joel is presenting at a "trade show" which turns out to be a ColdFusion conference. The interns admit they don't know what ColdFusion is.

### Y Combinator

Paul Graham is 41 years old. He had sold his startup, Viaweb, to Yahoo for $50M in 1998, then he became popular for the essays he published on his blog. Jessica Livingston is 34 years old. She was not active in the startup community at the time, having come from a career in marketing.

Paul and Jessica [had been dating for two years](http://paulgraham.com/worked.html) but weren't married yet. They had co-founded Y Combinator together with two others a few months before. They were in the middle of YC's first batch of companies, which included a then-unknown project called reddit.

### reddit

reddit had launched a few months before the documentary began filming, and it was not at all on anyone's radar. At the time, you could only post links. There was no commenting feature. Digg was the dominant player in this domain.

College roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian drove to Boston to attend one of Paul Graham's lectures in 2005. After graduating a few months later, they applied to Y Combinator and got accepted with reddit.

not at all relevant yet as a social networking platform. Digg was still the dominant

## As a documentary, it's not very good

The fundamental problem seemed like the documentary couldn't decide what it was. Is it a story about the intern project or the interns themselves? Or is it a story about Fog Creek in general? Or is it about tech culture in the mid-2000s?

The documentary tries to be lots of different things, so The total runtime with credits is only 78 minutes, and there's a lot of dead air. They keep interviewing a programmer at the Fog Creek office about his tomato plant, and it has no relevance to anything. They also do bizarre reenactments of things that didn't matter in the first place, like two of the interns finding a cockroach and getting scared.

One of the most exciting moments of the film is when they finally launch the product. It captures the feeling of vulnerability and failure when you think your product is going to be a sensation, and instead it just flops. They seem to just forget about it. They never explain when the first sale happened or talk to anyone about how they felt about the launch.

From just a technical level, it seemed like it was made by someone who didn't have much experience filming anything. The interviews are uncomfortably close to people's faces, often with harsh lighting and mediocre sound quality.

## The moment of truth

There's one scene in particular that drove me crazy.

It's the end of the internship, and Fog Creek is finally launching Copilot. They have a betting pool with predictions about when they'll make their first sale. Some guessed it would happen within XX minutes of launch, others thought it might take up to XX hours.

But the sale doesn't come. One by one, you see them cross off people's predictions. You see the team worried that this thing they expected to be a big hit maybe will be a complete flop.

As a founder, this moment is extremely relatable. There have been so many times where I put weeks or months of work into something with the expectation that people will love it, and then I discover after I launching that it was a complete miss.

I think the documentary does a great job of capturing that tension, that moment where you haven't definitely failed, but it's looking more likely that you failed.

The problem is that in _Aardvark'd_, they build excellent tension in that scene, and then seemingly forget what they were doing and move on. Copilot made a first sale at some point, but you never see anyone's reaction. You just see them celebrating later, and it's unclear if they've even made a first sale or they're just celebrating the launch.

I'm just baffled at the filmmaker's choice. Because at first, I thought maybe it's just something you don't get if you've never launched something, but it's not. This is basic storytelling.

It would be like if you ended the story of Little Red Riding Hood by saying, "And then Little Red Riding Hood realized her grandmother was a wolf! Suddenly, the wolf threw her to the floor and bared his razor-sharp teeth inches from her neck. Anyway, she ended up being fine. The End."

## What the documentary did well

I think it was relatable, especially because I was a college student at the same time. I felt like it was an accurate picture of culture at young tech firms of that era.

One thing I thought it captured really well was the self-important intern. In _Aardvark'd_, one of the Fog Creek interns speaks very seriously to the camera about how he has to stay grounded because one day, Fog Creek is going to be so big, and he so important within Fog Creek, that people will pass him in the hallway and greet him by name, but he won't know who they are.

It reminded me a lot of a guy in my computer science program who told me how much responsibility he was given at his fancy finance internship. He said he was so because once you're in, they'd always take care of you. This was in 2007, and the finance firm he was talking about was [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lehman_Brothers&oldid=1165023032#Bankruptcy).

## "Back when they were getting started, they were terrified"

> A lot of these tech startup founders who are extremely successful, back when they were getting started, they were terrified. And they were very unsure of what they were doing. They questioned things, and I'm sure doubted themselves... And so to see these people as vulnerable people at one point in time is interesting.

spez is now the widespread target of ire for greedily cutting third party clients out of the platform they helped build. But in 2005, he was a lovably doofy-looking kid who had such bad nightmares about reddit having an outage that he slept in bed with his laptop.

## Other takeaways

Dan Bricklin, creator of VisiCalc, didn't really grab me. I'm too young to have used VisiCalc, so maybe that's why.

Joel Spolsky surprisingly stingy with praise. Joel Spolsky continues focusing on his computer and just says, "Cool," and doesn't even turn from his computer screen.

The final line of the documentary is:

> We hire these incredible engineers. We hire people who are really, really brilliant individually and do incredible work. But that's sort of what we expect of them, so I don't really feel like it's necessary to puff up their ego too much by saying, "Wow, you did an unbelievable, great thing! Nobody else could have done this." What I really want to say is, "That's what we expected."

## Joel liked it, apparently

One of the most surprising parts of the documentary is that Joel Spolsky, someone who cares a lot about product quality, thinks _Aardvark'd_ was a good documentary. TODO: Link to part where he says it was good.

And maybe you think, he's of course going to say that. He's financially tied to the movie, so he wants to spin it positively regardless of how he feels.

But five years later, Fog Creek collaborated once again with Boondoggle Media on a video course called [_Make Better Software: The Training Series_](https://boondogglemedia.com/project/make-better-software/). Fog Creek [used to sell this course](https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014829/http://training.fogcreek.com/order.html) for $2000, but now Boondoggle Media has released it [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcIkt5s7w8D0ywp0CBmNFWRTFZic3pWNn).

On using GPL code:

> VNC is GPL. The two components we’re building based on VNC, the helper and victim, will need to bere-released under GPL.

> This is not that big a deal. The code will be highly optimized for our own use and will require the reflector to work, which will not be released under GPL.

On CSS:

> We will use CSS for formatting but not positioning since CSS positioning is too buggy on modern browsers: we’ll just use tables for most positioning.

Uses "Apps Hungarian" (also known as "Simonyi notation"), which Joel was a big proponent of.

Uses apps simonyl style, a style Joel strongly supported. Joel admits that coding conventions "doesn't belong in a functional specification, and it should really have been a separate document."

They did release the code, but I unfortunately couldn't find the original version the interns wrote. The earliest version I could find was from 2011, at which point the code had been rewritten from C# to C++. I suspect that was part of the [Copilot 2.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/01/26/copilot-20-ships/), as that's when they added Mac support, and they probably didn't feel like running .NET on Mac.

## Where are they now?

### The interns

#### Tyler Griffin Hicks-Wright

In 2012, Tyler left Fog Creek and launched a photo backup business called Snaposit. The company applied for funding from Y Combinator, but Tyler was rejected by his _Aardvark'd_ co-star, Paul Graham and [shuttered the business a year later](https://tghw.com/blog/well-that-sucks-what-else-you-got).

In 2014, Fog Creek restructured to spin out Trello in 2014, Tyler [acquired the Copilot product for an undisclosed sum](https://tghw.com/blog/copilot-coming-full-circle). He ran it on the side for eight years before [shutting it down in April 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31192812).

At the time of the shutdown notice, people assumed Tyler was shutting down the company to sell the copilot.com domain Github, who had recently launched a well-known product called Copilot. Surprisingly, the buyer wasn't Github but rather a company that makes CRM software for service businesses.

#### Michael Lehenbauer

https://twitter.com/mikelehen

According to his LinkedIn, after completing his undergrad at Rose Hulman, he started at Microsoft in 2006. I started a year later. He left in 2011 to join Firebase as employee #2. When Google acquired Firebase in 2014, Michael and I both worked at Google at the same time, though I don't recall ever crossing paths.

We have a mutual friend, and I'm surprised it's just one given so much employer overlap.

#### Ben Pollack

Ben acknowledges the _Aardvark'd_ documentary [on his website](https://www.bitquabit.com/meta/about/), saying:

> Oh, and at one point in my life, I was in a movie, which is available on YouTube if you’re feeling masochistic.

Worked at Fog Creek for several years

Sometimes had public debates with Tyler.
