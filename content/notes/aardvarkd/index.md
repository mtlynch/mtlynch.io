In 2005, Joel Spolsky's software company, Fog Creek, filmed a documentary about their summer internship program. _Aardvark'd: 12 Weeks with Geeks_ follows four college interns as they design, implement, and launch a completely new software product, but that's not the interesting part.

The movie features early interviews with many people who would go on to much greater fame and success, such as:

- Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston months after they co-founded Y Combinator
- Aaron Swartz, Steve Huffman, and Alexis Ohanian months after they launched reddit
- Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor before their mega-hits like StackOverflow, Trello, and Glitch

_Aardvark'd_ sold about 5,000 copies on DVD, mostly to fans of Joel's blog, but it quickly faded from popular consciousness. I've always been curious to watch _Aardvark'd_, so I was delighted that the filmmaker recently published it [for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrkZ07LKbk) at full 1080p.

At the time of this writing, _Aardvark'd_ has only 41 views on YouTube, which is shamefully low given the people it interviews.

## What was going on in 2005?

To understand what makes _Aardvark'd_ a fun watch, you have to understand what was going on at the time.

### Fog Creek Software

In 2005, [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky) was 40 years old. He had co-founded Fog Creek in 2000 with Michael Pryor. Aside from the founders, Fog Creek had six employees.

{{<img src="joel.webp" max-width="400px" caption="Joel Spolsky, Fog Creek co-founder, in 2005">}}

At the time, Fog Creek sold two products: FogBugz, a bug tracking application, and CityDesk, a web publishing tool. The company was bootstrapped and profitable enough to get by, but they weren't experiencing any kind of exponential hypergrowth.

### Y Combinator

[Paul Graham](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)>) and [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston) appear in the documentary because they had just co-founded [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), which would go on to become one of the most successful startup accelerators in the software industry.

{{<img src="paul-jessica.webp" max-width="600px" caption="Y Combinator co-cofounders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston in 2005">}}

At the time of the documentary, [Paul Graham](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)>) was 41 years old. Seven years prior, he had sold his startup [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb) to Yahoo for $50M. He then became popular online for [his essays about startups and software](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html). [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston) was 34 years old. She was not active in the startup community at the time, having come from a career in marketing.

Graham and Livingston [had been dating for two years](http://paulgraham.com/worked.html) but weren't married yet. The documentary interviews them in the middle of Y Combinator's first batch of startups, which included a then-unknown project called [reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit).

### reddit

reddit had launched a few months before the documentary began filming, and it was not at all on anyone's radar.

At the time, reddit only allowed users to post links &mdash; there was no commenting. [Fark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fark), [digg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg), and [slashdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot) were still the dominant platforms for social link sharing.

{{<img src="reddit-2005.webp" max-width="650px" has-border="true" caption="The reddit homepage [in 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050804002153/http://www.reddit.com/)">}}

In 2005, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian were college roommates. Earlier in the year, they had driven to Boston to attend one of Paul Graham's lectures about startups. Graham had dinner with them after the talk, which inspired him to create Y Combinator. reddit was in Y Combinator's first batch of investments.

{{<img src="ohanian-swartz-huffman.webp" max-width="700px" caption="reddit co-founders (right to left) Alexis Ohanian, Aaron Swartz, Steve Huffman in 2005">}}

Aaron Swartz was 19 at the time of filming. He had already had significant impact on the early web as one of the authors of the [RSS specification](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/docs/rss1.html) and an early contributor to [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), an organization that fought for ethical mechanisms for sharing intellectual property.

An undergrad at Stanford in 2005, Swartz was also accepted into Y Combinator's first batch. His company stalled, so Graham suggested he [merge with reddit](https://qz.com/594715/when-aaron-swartz-met-paul-graham-his-life-and-the-entire-internet-changed-forever).

## "Back when they were getting started, they were terrified"

As a documentary, _Aardvark’d_ is not very good. It seemed like the filmmaker didn't have much experience filming anything. The interviews are uncomfortably close to people's faces, often with harsh lighting and mediocre sound quality.

The film flits from topic to topic, but it never feels like it quite tells a cohesive story. Is it a story about the interns' project? Or is it about the interns themselves? Or is it a story about Fog Creek as a company? Or tech culture in the mid-2000s?

Still, I found it compelling.

There's a voiceover from Jessica Livingston that summarizes my favorite part of the documentary.

> A lot of these tech startup founders who are extremely successful, back when they were getting started, they were terrified.
>
> They were very unsure of what they were doing. They questioned things, and I'm sure doubted themselves...
>
> And so to see these people as vulnerable people at one point in time is interesting to me.

And it really rang true for me when I think about Steve Huffman, reddit's co-founder and current CEO.

Huffman is currently the target of widespread ire for [cutting third party clients out of the platform they helped build](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-lashes-out-on-protests-moderators-and-third-party-apps/). In 2005, Huffman was just a lovably doofy-looking kid. In his interview, he admits that he had such intense nightmares about reddit having an outage that he slept with his laptop in bed with him.

## The launch day scene

There's one _Aardvark'd_ scene in particular that drove me crazy.

It's the end of the internship, and Fog Creek is finally launching Copilot. Fog Creek's employees start a betting pool with predictions about when they'll make their first sale. Some guessed it would happen within a minute of launch, while others thought it might take up to an hour.

{{<img src="sale-predictions.webp" max-width="600px" caption="Fog Creek employees and interns make optimistic predictions about the first sale of Copilot">}}

But the sale doesn't come. One by one, you see the interns cross out predictions that turned out to be too optimistic. You're watching the team grow increasingly worried that their product might be a complete flop.

{{<gallery caption="Fog Creek interns anxiously awaiting their first customer">}}
{{<img src="cross-off.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{<img src="waiting.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{</gallery>}}

As a founder, I found this moment extremely relatable. There have been so many times where I put weeks or months of work into something that I was sure people would love. Then, after I launch it, I discover that I was completely wrong and nobody's interested in what I built.

The documentary does a great job of capturing that anxiety &mdash; that moment where you haven't definitely failed, but every minute that ticks by without a sale makes it more likely that you've made a big mistake. I've talked about it with other founders, but I've never seen it captured on video.

The problem is that _Aardvark'd_ builds excellent tension in that scene and then seemingly... forgets what it was doing.

The story just moves on to the next thing. The next scene is Joel popping champagne later that day, but it's not even clear if there's been a sale or if they're just celebrating the launch. You never see anyone's sighing in relief or admitting defeat.

It would be like if you ended the story of Little Red Riding Hood by saying, "And then Little Red Riding Hood realized her grandmother was a wolf! Suddenly, the wolf threw her to the floor and bared his razor-sharp teeth inches from her neck. Anyway, she ended up being fine. The End."

## What the documentary did well

I think it was relatable, especially because I was a college student at the same time. I felt like it was an accurate picture of culture at young tech firms of that era.

One thing I thought it captured really well was the self-important intern. In _Aardvark'd_, one of the Fog Creek interns speaks very seriously to the camera about how he has to stay grounded because one day, Fog Creek is going to be so big, and he'll be so important within Fog Creek, that people will pass him in the hallway and greet him by name, but he won't know who they are.

It reminded me a lot of a guy in my computer science program who told me how much responsibility he was given at his enviable finance internship. He spoke confidently of his future career with the company, telling me, "the brothers" would take care of him. This was in 2007, and he was describing his internship with [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lehman_Brothers&oldid=1165023032#Bankruptcy).

There's a funny moment later on, when that same intern, after spending most of the film thinking he's the smartest guy in the room, realizes a showstopper bug was his fault.

## Joel is not big on praise

Joel Spolsky surprisingly stingy with praise. In the penultimate scene, the marketing intern excitedly announces to Joel that he got an article about Fog Creek into the popular business magazine, _Crain's_.

Without turning from his computer screen, Joel Spolsky simply says, "Cool."

The intern stands in Joel's doorway, waiting hopefully for more praise or further acknowledgment. When it doesn't come, he slowly walks back to his desk.

Joel has the final line in the documentary, and it explains a bit more about this interaction:

> We hire people who are really, really brilliant individually and do incredible work. But that's sort of what we expect of them
>
> I don't really feel like it's necessary to puff up their ego too much by saying, "Wow, you did an unbelievable, great thing! Nobody else could have done this."
>
> What I really want to say is, "That's what we expected."

## Fog Creek didn't finance the documentary

In researching the documentary, one of the big surprises was that Fog Creek didn't actually finance it. I had remembered it as essentially a vanity project that Fog Creek funded as advertising, but reading the [job posting](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/03/23/documentary-filmmaker-wanted/), I realized it was more of an angel investor model:

> We’re looking for a filmmaker who will finance and make the film themselves and own the rights. We want someone who can promote the film to typical documentary outlets...

Spolsky said in his blog that he paid the filmmaker $5k stipend and $5k for expenses, but [a later column](https://web.archive.org/web/20230712203549/https://www.inc.com/magazine/20080101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-four-pillars-of-organic-growth.html) he wrote for _Inc._ magazine says, "We ended up paying the filmmaker about $30,000."

It's an interesting choice, and I guess it worked. Fog Creek no longer cares about Copilot or _Aardvark'd_. They've taken the intern's development blog offline, and Joel has deleted many of the artifacts related to Copilot. But the filmmaker still cared enough about _Aardvark'd_ that he uploaded a high-def copy to YouTube 18 years later.

## The artifacts of Aardvark

After Fog Creek released Copilot, Joel Spolsky published the original design spec [on his blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/08/17/the-project-aardvark-spec/). The link to the actual PDF is now dead, but the Internet Archive [has a copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028171624/https://www.joelonsoftware.com/RandomStuff/copilot_spec.pdf).

The tone is informal and conversational. After watching the documentary, I can hear Joel's voice in my head as I read the spec.

> All design and engineering decisions will be taken with the following principle in mind:
>
> **Simple is better than complicated.**
>
> We will always try to eliminate choices that the user must make. Every bump on the user experience must be relentlessly sanded down. Our customers will say: “It’s the easiest thing in the world and It Just Works.” No jargon will remain in the user experience, anywhere.

It echoes Joel's still-excellent online book, [_User Interface Design For Programmers_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/24/user-interface-design-for-programmers/).

The entire thing is clearly made in Microsoft Word. There are a couple of flow charts from Microsoft Visio. But the UI mockups are all just

> The initial rollout will go onto our existing web servers -- high end, well-endowed Dell 2850s – each of
> which can handle the entire Aardvark load by itself if necessary. The system will be highly scalable so we
> can add additional servers progressively to handle more load. Our web servers are named web1 and
> web2. We will move rapidly to add servers if the service is popular.

Seeing 2005 architecture.

> Our primary goal is to rollout a fully-functional version of Aardvark in only one summer. That means
> that the initial version will almost certainly not be optimal in every way and will not contain every
> feature. Throughout this spec, the notation (v2) will be used to indicate features which will not be a
> part of the initial product but which will be added later.

v2 I wonder if it would happen today. Conventional wisdom is not to even think about a v2. One of the habits I've had to unlearn from years at working at Microsoft and Google is, "How do I design this to be flexible for the v2." When you're bootstrapping, often, there isn't a v2. Or the features you think will be in v2 end up being totally different after hearing from customers. So telling interns to design with v2 in mind means they design for more flexibility than is warranted. Because as [Fred Brooks predicted](https://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway), they threw away all their original C# code for v2 and rewrote everything in C++.

On using GPL code:

> VNC is GPL. The two components we’re building based on VNC, the helper and victim, will need to bere-released under GPL.
>
> This is not that big a deal. The code will be highly optimized for our own use and will require the reflector to work, which will not be released under GPL.

On CSS:

> We will use CSS for formatting but not positioning since CSS positioning is too buggy on modern browsers: we’ll just use tables for most positioning.

Uses "Apps Hungarian" (also known as "Simonyi notation"), which Joel was a big proponent of.

Uses apps simonyl style, a style Joel strongly supported. Joel admits that coding conventions "doesn't belong in a functional specification, and it should really have been a separate document."

They did release the code, but I unfortunately couldn't find the original version the interns wrote. The [earliest version I could find](https://web.archive.org/web/20150911071232/https://www.copilot.com/copilot_helper_src.zip/) was from 2011, at which point the code had been rewritten from C# to C++. I suspect this rewrite happened in [Copilot 2.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/01/26/copilot-20-ships/), as that's when they added Mac support, and they probably didn't feel like trying to run .NET on Mac in 2007.

## _Make Better Software: The Training Series_

Five years later, Fog Creek collaborated once again with Boondoggle Media on a video course called [_Make Better Software: The Training Series_](https://boondogglemedia.com/project/make-better-software/). Fog Creek [used to sell this course](https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014829/http://training.fogcreek.com/order.html) for $2000, but now Boondoggle Media has released it [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcIkt5s7w8D0ywp0CBmNFWRTFZic3pWNn).

I'm watching it, and it's pretty good. It's kind of like a video version of Joel Spolsky's most famous blog posts, and they show how they put those ideas into practice at Fog Creek.

## What happened to the interns?

[Tyler Griffin Hicks-Wright](https://tghw.com) and [Ben Pollack](https://www.bitquabit.com/meta/about/) accepted full-time positions at Fog Creek after their internships and worked there for several years. They both blogged, sometimes having public squabbles about programming languages (TODO: link).

In 2012, Tyler left Fog Creek and launched a photo backup business called Snaposit. The company applied for funding from Y Combinator. Tyler's _Aardvark'd_ co-star, Paul Graham, rejected his pitch, and Tyler [shuttered the business a year later](https://tghw.com/blog/well-that-sucks-what-else-you-got).

In 2014, Fog Creek restructured to spin out Trello, its ultra-successful product. As part of the restructuring, Fog Creek sold Copilot to Tyler, who was one of the original implementers and maintained the product for several years as a Fog Creek employee. [acquired the Copilot product from Fog Creek for an undisclosed sum](https://tghw.com/blog/copilot-coming-full-circle). He ran Copilot on the side for eight years before [shutting it down in April 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31192812).

At the time of the shutdown notice, people assumed Tyler was shutting down the company to sell the copilot.com domain Github, who had recently launched a well-known AI product called Copilot. Surprisingly, the buyer wasn't Github but rather a company that makes CRM software for service businesses.

[Michael Lehenbauer](https://twitter.com/mikelehen) According to his LinkedIn, after completing his undergrad at Rose Hulman, he started at Microsoft in 2006. I started a year later. He left in 2011 to join Firebase as employee #2. When Google acquired Firebase in 2014, Michael and I both worked at Google at the same time, though I don't recall ever crossing paths.

### Reddit founders

#### Aaron Swartz

He continued working on reddit after Conde Nast acquired it, but he [complained publicly](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/officespace) about working within a larger corporation and was fired from the company [in 2007](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-05-07-n78.html).

Aaron died by suicide at 2013 when he was 26 years old. This [followed extreme pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) from the FBI.

Swartz's [blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/) is still available online, and there's a separate documentary about his life called [_The Internet's Own Boy_](https://archive.org/details/TheInternetsOwnBoyTheStoryOfAaronSwartz).

#### Steve Huffman

Steve Huffman left reddit in 2006 .

He co-founded Hipmunk in 2010, again receiving funding from Y Combinator, but he left in 2015, to re-join reddit as CEO.

#### Alexis Ohanian

Alexis stepped down as CEO. He hasn't founded any major companies, but he serves in an advisory role in many companies. In 2017, he married tennis star [Serena Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams).
