title: "Aardvark'd: The Fog Creek Documentary, 18 Years Later"

In 2005, Joel Spolsky's software company, Fog Creek, filmed a documentary about their summer internship program. _Aardvark'd: 12 Weeks with Geeks_ follows four college interns as they design, implement, and launch a completely new software product. That's not the interesting part.

Looking back on this documentary 18 years later, it's striking how many interviews it captured with people who would go on to greater fame and success:

- Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston months after they co-founded Y Combinator
- Aaron Swartz, Steve Huffman, and Alexis Ohanian months after they launched reddit
- Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor before their mega-hits like StackOverflow, Trello, and Glitch

_Aardvark'd_ sold about 5,000 copies on DVD, mostly to fans of Joel's blog, but it quickly faded from popular consciousness.

I've always been curious to watch _Aardvark'd_, so I was delighted that the filmmaker recently published it [for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrkZ07LKbk) at full 1080p. At the time of this writing, _Aardvark'd_ has only 41 views on YouTube, which is surprisingly low given the caliber of people it features.

## What was going on in 2005?

To understand what makes _Aardvark'd_ a fun watch, it's helpful to understand where things stood in 2005.

### Fog Creek Software

In 2005, [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky) was 40 years old. He had co-founded Fog Creek in 2000 with Michael Pryor. Aside from the founders, Fog Creek had six employees. They sold two products: FogBugz, a bug tracking application, and CityDesk, a web publishing tool. The company was profitable enough to get by without external investors, but they weren't experiencing any kind of exponential hypergrowth.

### Y Combinator

[Paul Graham](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)>) and [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston) had just co-founded [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), which would go on to become one of the most successful startup accelerators in the software industry.

{{<img src="paul-jessica.webp" max-width="600px" caption="Y Combinator co-cofounders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston in 2005">}}

Graham was 41 years old, and Livingston was 34. Seven years prior, he had sold his startup [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb) to Yahoo for $50M. He then became popular online for [his essays about startups and software](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html). Livingston was not active in the startup community at the time, having come from a career in marketing.

Graham and Livingston [had been dating for two years](http://paulgraham.com/worked.html) but weren't married yet. The documentary interviews them in the middle of Y Combinator's first batch of startups, which included a then-unknown project called [reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit).

### reddit

reddit had launched a few months before the documentary began filming, and it was not at all on anyone's radar.

At the time, reddit only allowed users to post links &mdash; there was no commenting. [Fark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fark), [digg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg), and [slashdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot) were still the dominant platforms for social link sharing.

{{<img src="reddit-2005.webp" max-width="650px" has-border="true" caption="The reddit homepage [in 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050804002153/http://www.reddit.com/)">}}

Early in 2005, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, who were college roommates drove to Boston to attend one of Paul Graham's lectures about startups. Graham had dinner with them after the talk, which inspired him to create Y Combinator. reddit was in Y Combinator's first batch of investments.

{{<img src="ohanian-swartz-huffman.webp" max-width="700px" caption="reddit co-founders (right to left) Alexis Ohanian, Aaron Swartz, Steve Huffman in 2005">}}

Aaron Swartz was 19 at the time of filming. He had already had significant impact on the early web as one of the authors of the [RSS specification](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/docs/rss1.html) and an early contributor to [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), an organization that fought for ethical mechanisms for sharing intellectual property.

An undergrad at Stanford in 2005, Swartz was also accepted into Y Combinator's first batch. When his company stalled, Graham suggested he [merge with reddit](https://qz.com/594715/when-aaron-swartz-met-paul-graham-his-life-and-the-entire-internet-changed-forever).

## "Back when they were getting started, they were terrified"

As a documentary, _Aardvark’d_ is not very good. It seemed like the filmmaker didn't have much experience filming anything. The shots are always uncomfortably close to people's faces, often with harsh lighting and mediocre sound quality.

The film flits from topic to topic without ever landing on a cohesive story. Is it a story about the interns' project? Or is it about the interns themselves? Or is it a story about Fog Creek as a company? Or tech culture in the mid-2000s?

Still, I found it compelling.

There's a voiceover from Jessica Livingston that summarizes what makes the film engaging despite its flaws:

> A lot of these tech startup founders who are extremely successful, back when they were getting started, they were terrified.
>
> They were very unsure of what they were doing. They questioned things, and I'm sure doubted themselves...
>
> And so to see these people as vulnerable people at one point in time is interesting to me.

And it really rang true for me when I think about Steve Huffman, reddit's co-founder and current CEO.

Huffman is currently the target of widespread ire for [cutting third party clients out of the platform they helped build](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-lashes-out-on-protests-moderators-and-third-party-apps/). But in 2005, Huffman was just a lovably doofy-looking kid. In his interview, he admits that he had such intense nightmares about reddit having an outage that he slept with his laptop in bed with him.

## The infuriating launch day scene

There's one _Aardvark'd_ scene in particular that drove me crazy.

The main storyline of the documentary is the interns' summer project, which would eventually become Copilot. No, not the AI coding tool. Fog Creek Copilot was a tool that let people provide remote computer assistance to friends, family, and co-workers.

So, it's the end of the internship, and Fog Creek is finally launching Copilot. This feels like the climax of the film &mdash; the result of all the work we've watched them do throughout the movie.

The interns and employees start a betting pool with predictions about when they'll make their first sale. Some guessed it would happen within a minute of launch, while others thought it might take up to an hour.

{{<img src="sale-predictions.webp" max-width="600px" caption="Fog Creek employees and interns make optimistic predictions about the first sale of Copilot">}}

But the sale doesn't come. As each minute rolls by, the interns glumly cross out predictions that turned out to be too optimistic. You're watching the team grow increasingly worried that their product might be a complete flop.

{{<gallery caption="Fog Creek interns anxiously awaiting their first customer">}}
{{<img src="cross-off.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{<img src="waiting.webp" max-width="600px">}}
{{</gallery>}}

As a founder, I found this moment extremely relatable. There have been so many times where I put weeks or months of work into something that I was sure people would love. Then, I launch it only to discover that I was completely wrong and nobody's interested.

But the thing about failed software launches is that there's never an exact moment when you discover that you failed. Even if you don't get the results you want immediately, there's a desperate hope that it could turn around. Maybe it's going to land on the front page of Hacker News. Maybe someone with a huge audience will share it.

The documentary does a great job of capturing that anxiously ambiguous time &mdash; you haven't failed for sure, but every minute that ticks by without a sale brings your chances of success closer to 0. I've talked about it with other founders, but I've never seen it captured on video.

The problem is that _Aardvark'd_ builds excellent tension in that scene and then apparently forgets what it was doing.

In the next scene, Joel is popping champagne, but it's not even clear if there's been a sale or if they're just celebrating the launch. You never see anyone's sighing in relief or admitting defeat.

{{<img src="joel-champagne.webp" max-width="600px" caption="What are we celebrating, exactly?">}}

It would be like if you ended the story of Little Red Riding Hood by saying, "And then Little Red Riding Hood realized her grandmother was a wolf! Suddenly, the wolf threw her to the floor and bared his razor-sharp teeth inches from her neck. Anyway, she ended up being fine. The End."

## The artifacts of Aardvark

After Fog Creek released Copilot, Joel Spolsky published the original design spec [on his blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/08/17/the-project-aardvark-spec/). The link to the actual PDF is now dead, but the Internet Archive [has a copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028171624/https://www.joelonsoftware.com/RandomStuff/copilot_spec.pdf).

### An emphasis on simplicity

The tone is informal and conversational. After watching the documentary, I can hear Joel's voice in my head as I read the spec.

> All design and engineering decisions will be taken with the following principle in mind:
>
> **Simple is better than complicated.**
>
> We will always try to eliminate choices that the user must make. Every bump on the user experience must be relentlessly sanded down. Our customers will say: “It’s the easiest thing in the world and It Just Works.” No jargon will remain in the user experience, anywhere.

It echoes Joel's still-excellent online book, [_User Interface Design For Programmers_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/24/user-interface-design-for-programmers/).

The entire thing is clearly made in Microsoft Word. There are a couple of flow charts from Microsoft Visio. But the UI mockups are all just

### The Copilot architecture

Seeing 2005 architecture. Similar to StackOverflow

> The initial rollout will go onto our existing web servers -- high end, well-endowed Dell 2850s – each of which can handle the entire Aardvark load by itself if necessary. The system will be highly scalable so we can add additional servers progressively to handle more load. Our web servers are named web1 and web2. We will move rapidly to add servers if the service is popular.

### Designing into the future

I was surprised to see how much Joel tried to predict what Copilot would do in v2:

> Our primary goal is to rollout a fully-functional version of Aardvark in only one summer. That means that the initial version will almost certainly not be optimal in every way and will not contain every feature. Throughout this spec, the notation (v2) will be used to indicate features which will not be a part of the initial product but which will be added later.

Before Fog Creek, Joel spent most of his career at Microsoft. At Microsoft, if you go to the trouble to launch a new product, of course there's going to be a v2. As a bootstrapped founder,

### A one-way relationship with open-source code

v2 I wonder if it would happen today. Conventional wisdom is not to even think about a v2. One of the habits I've had to unlearn from years at working at Microsoft and Google is, "How do I design this to be flexible for the v2." When you're bootstrapping, often, there isn't a v2. Or the features you think will be in v2 end up being totally different after hearing from customers. So telling interns to design with v2 in mind means they design for more flexibility than is warranted. Because as [Fred Brooks predicted](https://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway), they threw away all their original C# code for v2 and rewrote everything in C++.

Joel declares a fairly cynical plan to use open-source code in an openly parasitic way. Fog Creek enjoys the benefits of open-source VNC code while preventing anyone else from benefitting from Fog Creek's work:

> VNC is GPL. The two components we’re building based on VNC, the helper and victim, will need to be re-released under GPL.
>
> This is not that big a deal. The code will be highly optimized for our own use and will require the reflector to work, which will not be released under GPL.

Fog Creek did publish their GPL-derived code, but I unfortunately couldn't find the original version the interns wrote. The [earliest version I could find](https://web.archive.org/web/20150911071232/https://www.copilot.com/copilot_helper_src.zip/) was from 2011. By that point, they had rewritten the C# codebase in C++. I suspect this rewrite happened when they added Mac support in [Copilot 2.0](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/01/26/copilot-20-ships/). They probably didn't feel like trying to run .NET code on Mac in 2007.

### A healthy distrust of CSS

In 2005, Joel was still distrustful of CSS and deliberately limited it as a dependency:

> We will use CSS for formatting but not positioning since CSS positioning is too buggy on modern browsers: we’ll just use tables for most positioning.

## Some good quotes

{{<img src="graham-no-business-guys.webp" max-width="600px">}}

> I think the relationship between hackers and business guys &mdash; at least in the beginning &mdash; is that you need hackers, and you don't need business guys.
>
> -Paul Graham

{{<img src="aaron-swartz.webp" max-width="600px">}}

> You don't have to be in this fake world of school doing some silly assignment that has no real purpose. You can build something that's actually useful. You can go put it up on your website, and people can really use it. If you can build something real, why spend your life doing stuff that's fake?
>
> -Aaron Swartz

## Joel is not big on praise

Joel Spolsky surprisingly stingy with praise. In the penultimate scene, the marketing intern excitedly announces to Joel that he got an article about Fog Creek into the popular business magazine, _Crain's_.

Without turning from his computer screen, Joel Spolsky simply says, "Cool."

The intern stands in Joel's doorway, waiting hopefully for more praise or further acknowledgment. When it doesn't come, he slowly walks back to his desk.

Joel has the final line in the documentary, and it explains a bit more about this interaction:

> We hire people who are really, really brilliant individually and do incredible work. But that's sort of what we expect of them
>
> I don't really feel like it's necessary to puff up their ego too much by saying, "Wow, you did an unbelievable, great thing! Nobody else could have done this."
>
> What I really want to say is, "That's what we expected."

## Fog Creek didn't finance the documentary

In researching the documentary, one of the big surprises was that Fog Creek didn't actually finance it. I had remembered it as essentially a vanity project that Fog Creek funded as advertising, but reading the [job posting](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/03/23/documentary-filmmaker-wanted/), I realized it was more of an angel investor model:

> We’re looking for a filmmaker who will finance and make the film themselves and own the rights. We want someone who can promote the film to typical documentary outlets...

Spolsky said in his blog that he paid the filmmaker $5k stipend and $5k for expenses. In [a later column](https://web.archive.org/web/20230712203549/https://www.inc.com/magazine/20080101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-four-pillars-of-organic-growth.html) he wrote for _Inc._ magazine says, "We ended up paying the filmmaker about $30,000."

It's an interesting choice, and I guess it worked. Fog Creek no longer cares about Copilot or _Aardvark'd_. They've taken the intern's development blog offline, and Joel has deleted many of the artifacts related to Copilot. But the filmmaker still cared enough about _Aardvark'd_ that he uploaded a high-def copy to YouTube 18 years later.

## What happened to the interns?

[Tyler Griffin Hicks-Wright](https://tghw.com) accepted a full-time position at Fog Creek after their internships and worked there for several years. He left in 2012, to start a photo backup business called Snaposit. The company applied for funding from Y Combinator. Tyler's _Aardvark'd_ co-star, Paul Graham, rejected his pitch, and Tyler [shuttered the business a year later](https://tghw.com/blog/well-that-sucks-what-else-you-got).

In 2014, Fog Creek restructured to spin out Trello, its ultra-successful product. As part of the restructuring, Fog Creek sold their Copilot product to Tyler [for an undisclosed sum](https://tghw.com/blog/copilot-coming-full-circle). He ran Copilot on the side for eight years before [shutting it down in April 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31192812).

[Michael Lehenbauer](https://twitter.com/mikelehen) took a job at Microsoft after his _Aardvark'd_ internship. He left in 2011 to join Firebase as employee #2, which I can only assume means he's now relaxing on a superyacht somewhere. Michael and I worked seven overlapping years at Microsoft and Google, though I don't recall us ever crossing paths.

## Liz Gordon's fun arc

One of the most affable people in _Aardvark'd_ is Liz Gordon, Fog Creek's recently-hired office manager.

Liz is presented in the film as the non-nerd outsider at Fog Creek. She ends up having to coddle and indulge a bunch of college interns a few years her junior who have somewhat inflated egos as subjects of a documentary.

{{<img src="liz-gordon-laughing.webp" max-width="700px" caption="&ldquo;There's always a better way to do something, and that's what \[the interns\] are always trying to figure out... what star trooper is going to kick some other superhero's butt, and how they're going to do it. Or what's the best way to use a lightsaber.&rdquo; -Liz Gordon">}}

In one scene, she's being interviewed on her birthday. Nobody remembered, so she has to buy herself a birthday hat. While she's explaining this to the camera, one of her co-workers _shushes_ her. On her birthday!

{{<img src="liz-gordon-shush.webp" max-width="700px" caption="Liz Gordon being shushed on her birthday at the Fog Creek office">}}

It turns out, she stuck with Fog Creek and rose along with the company, eventually taking on the role of Head of People.

When Fog Creek spun Trello out into its own company, Liz became Trello's VP of People and retained the role through Trello's acquisition by Atlassian. She's now [Liz Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-hall-8939551b/) and is a C-suite executive at [Splash](https://splashthat.com), where I presume nobody tries to shush her on her birthday.

{{<img src="liz-hall.webp" max-width="450px" has-border="true" caption="Liz Hall is now Chief People Officer at Splash.">}}

## _Make Better Software: The Training Series_

Five years later, Fog Creek collaborated once again with Boondoggle Media on a video course called [_Make Better Software: The Training Series_](https://boondogglemedia.com/project/make-better-software/). Fog Creek [used to sell this course](https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014829/http://training.fogcreek.com/order.html) for $2000, but now Boondoggle Media has released it [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcIkt5s7w8D0ywp0CBmNFWRTFZic3pWNn).

I'm watching it, and it's pretty good. It's kind of like a video version of Joel Spolsky's most famous blog posts, and they show how they put those ideas into practice at Fog Creek. Most of the Fog Creek employees and interns are still there in the training series with the exception of interns Michael and Yaron.
