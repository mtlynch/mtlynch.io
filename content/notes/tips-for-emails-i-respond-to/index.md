title: "Increasing Your Reply Rate on Cold Emails to Me"

There are lots of guides on writing cold emails. This one is hyperspecific, and I'm more qualified than anyone to write it because it's for people who cold email me, Michael Lynch.

When I see other people post these guides to emailing them, I roll my eyes and privately judge them for being self-important. But I also get a lot of emails from people who invest time into writing emails not realizing that they're making some mistake that will cause me to never respond.

These guidelines are released under TODO, so you can adapt or reuse them on your site if you [honor the license](/how-to-republish-adapt/).

## Things that increase my chances of responding

### Your email benefits me in some way

I know this sounds selfish, but this is true.

Note that helping people is something I enjoy, so

- Offers an improvement on something I've written about.
- Offers a solution to a problem I've written about but can't figure out.

### You're also a bootstrapped founder

Meaning you've tried to run a business, not that you've idly thought about it a lot.

You don't have to be a successful founder. If you've had 20 flops, that's more interesting to me than someone who just put up a landing page yesterday.

I'm 100x more likely to respond if you've tried

### You write publicly

You have a blog or you've published books. It doesn't have to be a popular blog or a beautiful blog or even a good blog. As long as you're writing with your human mind and human hands, I'm interested.

YouTube counts, Twitter doesn't.

### We have similar interests

### We have a common friend or acquaintance

### We've done something similar

- e.g., worked at the same place, lived in the same city, attended the same school, drank from the same water bottle.

## Things that decrease my chances of responding

### Immediately asking me to meet with you

I do sometimes meet with people who cold email me, but it's usually when there's some opportunity for us to work together or

### Asking something I've already answered in my blog

I'm less likely to respond to someone who wants an individualized

You're not going to have perfect awareness of my blog, but try searching my site to see if I've written about the topic before you email.

### Giving unsolicited advice

Especially if it's advice about something you're not qualified to give advice about.

### Your email is templated

If you're reaching out because something I wrote resonated with you, tell me what it was. If you just say, "I read your blog, and I really enjoy your writing," it might be a sincere sentiment, but it's also what 99% of spam I receive looks like, so I might mistake you for a bot.

### Your email looks AI-generated

If you're reaching out because something I wrote resonated with you, tell me what it was. If you just say, "I read your blog, and I really enjoy your writing," it might be a sincere sentiment, but it's also what 99% of spam I receive looks like, so I might mistake you for a bot.

### You insert trackers into your email

If you use an email service that injects hidden pixels or you use special links that track when I've clicked, I'm a lot less likely to respond. I understand that it's interesting to know who read and clicked your email, but I find it disrespectful to try to track me that way, especially in ways that are not obvious.

## Things that I definitely won't respond to

### Private tech support

If you're emailing about an open-source project I've published, make sure you recognize that open-source authors are not obligated to help you. If anything, you owe them a favor because they created something that you use.

If the project is on Github or Gitlab, file an issue there. If the project is archived or doesn't offer a way to request support, I don't support that project anymore.

If it's a question about a blog post that doesn't have a repo, I'm more likely to respond if you instead leave your question as a comment on the relevant post. That way, if I respond to you, everyone else benefits. Also, someoene else may respond to you if I don't have time.

### A job offer

I'm happy working for myself.

## Examples

### Good:

> From: Paul Graham<br>
> To: Michael Lynch<br>
> Subject: Great work
>
> Hey Michael,
>
> Love your blog. Great stuff! It's taught me a lot about writing and entrepreneurship!
>
> I notice that you post a lot on Hacker News. Did you know I actually founded the company that runs that site? Small world, LOL!
>
> I'd like to send you $5 million as a thank you.
>
> -pg

I like this email because it's very to the point. It doesn't ask a lot of me.

It establishes common interests.

### Bad: Technical support

These are made up

> Windows won't boot. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?
