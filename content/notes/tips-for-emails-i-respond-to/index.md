## Things that increase my chances of responding

### It benefits me in some way

### We've done something similar

- e.g., worked at the same place, lived in the same city

### You're also a bootstrapped founder

Meaning you've tried to run a business, not that you've idly thought about it a lot.

You don't have to be a successful founder. If you've had 20 flops, that's more interesting to me than someone who just put up a landing page yesterday.

I'm 100x more likely to respond if you've tried

### You write publicly

You have a blog or you've published books.

YouTube counts.

Twitter doesn't count.

### You've searched my blog for what I've shared already

I'm less likely to respond to someone who wants an individualized

### We have similar interests

### We have a common friend or acquaintance

## Things that decrease my chances of responding

### Immediately asking me to meet with you

I do sometimes meet with people who cold email me, but it's usually when there's some opportunity for us to work together or

### Your email looks AI-generated or templated

If you're reaching out because something I wrote resonated with you, tell me what it was. If you just say, "I read your blog, and I really enjoy your writing," it might be a sincere sentiment, but it's also what 99% of spam I receive looks like, so I might mistake you for a bot.

### You include tracking links or pixels in your email

If you use an email service that injects hidden pixels or you use special links that track when I've clicked, I'm a lot less likely to respond.

## Things that I definitely won't respond to

### Private tech support

No

If you're emailing about an open-source project I've published, make sure you recognize that open-source authors are not obligated to help you. If anything, you owe them a favor because they worked on something you use.

If the project is on Github or Gitlab, file an issue there. If the project is archived or doesn't offer a way to request support, I don't support that project anymore.

If it's a question about a blog post that doesn't have a repo, I'm more likely to respond if you instead leave your question as a comment on the relevant post. That way, if I respond to you, everyone else benefits. Also, someoene else may respond to you if I don't have time.

### A job offer

I'm happy working for myself.
