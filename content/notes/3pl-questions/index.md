Over the past six months, I've been transitioning the fulfillment processes at my e-commerce business to a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor.

I didn't know anything about 3PLs before starting this process, so there were a lot of things I didn't know to ask about. Here are the list of questions that I recommend e-commerce merchants ask a 3PL if they're considering working with them for fulfillment.

## Customer profile

- Do you have other clients whose order volumes are similar to mine?
  - What's the minimum and maximum order volume you can support?
- Do you have other clients whose products are similar to mine in price?
- Do you have other clients whose products are similar to mine in weight and volume?

## Integration with e-commerce platforms

- What's the process of connecting to my e-commerce platform?
  - Do I install an app?
  - Do [I have to make you admin in my Shopify store?](/retrospectives/2023/04/#everyone-just-gives-us-their-admin-password)
- How quickly does your order management system sync with my e-commerce platform?
  - i.e., when you print a shipping label, how quickly do I see that reflected in Shopify?
- How do I present your shipping rates to my customers?
  - Can I present real-time shipping rates from your couriers or do we need to use flat shipping fees?

## Recordkeeping / auditing

- How often do you do stocktakes?
- How will you share records of inventory changes with me?
  - i.e., When did products arrive at your warehouse? When did they go out for customer orders? When did stocktakes happen?

## Schedule

- Which days of the week do you fulfill orders?
- What holidays do you observe?
- What's the typical turnaround time for fulfilling an order?

## Shipping

- Which shipping couriers do you support for domestic orders?
- Which shipping couriers do you support for international orders?
  - Can you ship international orders [delivered duty paid (DDP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivery-duty-paid.asp)?

## Payment

- What are your fees?
- How do you accept payment?
  - Do you charge a surcharge for different payment options (e.g., surcharge for credit cards)?

## Handling issues and unusual orders

- What's your error rate?
  - i.e., how often do customers receive the wrong item or wrong quantities?
- Who absorbs costs of a fulfillment error?
  - What if we have to re-ship with expedited shipping to meet a customer deadline?
  - What if you sent a more expensive item and the customer has already opened it or refuses to return it?
- How do we handle it if a customer [places an order and then emails me to make a change](/retrospectives/2023/02/#what-if-a-customer-changes-their-order)?
  - Will changes in my e-commerce platform immediately sync to your order management system?
- How do we handle it when a customer asks us to hold off on fulfilling an order?
  - What's the process of pausing fulfillment on an order?
  - Will your order management system recognize Shopify's "pause fulfillment" feature?
