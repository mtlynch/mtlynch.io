These were my takeaways. This is not meant to be a summary of the whole interview, just the parts that stood out to me that I'd like to remember.

## Blogging every day

- Inspired by Tom Scott, who made a video every day for 10 years.
- Gives Simon incentive to find something interesting that day.

## Blogging investment

- Simon blogs for 10-15 minutes/day.
- He's able to write more quickly since he's been doing it for 22 years.

## Everything is a Github issue

- Maintains 250 projects. The only way to do it is if he pretends he's going to forget every detail.
- He writes design documents as issues as well.

> I've got issue threads that are over a hundred comments long, and they're all me. It's just me talking to myself.

\[_Editor's note: I would hate this._\]

### "Temporal documentation"

- Documenting what was true at the time, though not necessarily what's still true.

## Blog to newsletter pipeline

- Simon has a newsletter that's just a diff of everything new on his blog since his last newsletter.

> It's a really great way of getting things out there to people who live in their email clients.

- Simon wrote an Observable notebook that pulls content from his blog and converts it into Substack-compatible rich text. He then copies from the notebook into Substack, and sends out the newsletter.
- He has 6,000 substack subscribers.
- The process takes two minutes per newsletter.

\[_Editor's note: Simon doesn't address this, but I think this can have a negative effect on SEO, as it creates two copies of the same content at different URLs, and Google won't know which is the original._]

\[_Editor's note: I also find it surprising that Simon uses the Substack domain rather than some subdomain under simonwillison.com, which Substack supports._]

## Blog setup

- Simon's main blog is a Heroku instance sitting behind Cloudflare as CDN.

> he great thing about Cloudflare is if I get a giant spike of traffic, like if I'm linked off the Hacker News homepage, my tiny little cheap Heroku instance doesn't even notice because Cloudflare absorbs all of the traffic, and that's great.

## Bing chat incident

- Led to 1.4 million views on that page.

## Plugins vs. contributions

TODO

## Simon aspires to be financially independent

- This was actually the biggest surprise to me of the whole interview. I assumed he was already financially independent.
