I'm teaching a live course about how I've found success sharing my blog posts on Hacker News. [Sign up](#sign-up) by Monday (June 24th) to to reserve your slot.

## Why take a class with me?

My blog receives 300k-500k unique readers per year. After Google, Hacker News is the primary way that new readers find my writing.

In the past five years, [40+ of my posts](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=mtlynch.io&sort=byPopularity&type=story) have reached the front page of Hacker News. Seven of them have landed in the #1 spot.

It wasn't always this way. I started blogging in 2016, and it took me years of sending my articles into the void before I figured out how to connect my writing with large audiences.

I frequently see smart, talented writers who struggle to find an audience for their writing, so I want to teach you what I've spent the last eight years learning.

## Curriculum

### Lesson 1: Understanding Hacker News

_Week of June 24th, 2024_

Hacker News has its own distinctive culture. Before you can succeed there, it's important to understand its rules, etiquette, and conventions.

In this lesson, I'll explain the culture of Hacker News, why it's a great platform for sharing writing related to software, hardware, or entrepreneurship, and how to avoid missteps that will get you banned.

### Lesson 2: Choosing the Right Topics

_Week of July 1st, 2024_

It doesn't matter how good your article is if you pick a topic that's a poor match for Hacker News.

In this lesson, I'll share article topics that work well on Hacker News. I'll also show you how to avoid wasting time on articles that have a low probability of success on Hacker News.

### Lesson 3: Finding a Plan B

_Week of July 8th, 2024_

If your only plan for sharing your writing is submitting it to Hacker News, you're going to get your heart broken a lot.

In this lesson, I'll show how to find other channels in which to share your articles if they don't receive attention on Hacker News.

### Lesson 4: Elevate Your Writing

_Week of July 15th, 2024_

Want an unfair advantage over everyone else on Hacker News? Invest in your writing.

You don't have to be born an amazing writer. You can improve your writing and make it more engaging simply by putting in more effort.

In this lesson, I'll talk about simple techniques to make your writing more engaging, how to avoid common writing pitfalls, and how to continually improve your writing.

### Lesson 5: Submission Day

_Week of July 22nd, 2024_

In this section, I'll walk you through the process of submitting your post to Hacker News, how to make the most out of your time on the front page, and how to keep the comment thread civil and friendly.

Even the best of posts sometimes get ignored by Hacker News.

In this lesson, I'll show you what to do when your post fails to reach the front page, and why it's not always as hopeless as it may first appear.

### Lesson 6: My Process from Start to Finish

_Week of July 29th, 2024_

I've been developing an effective writing and publishing workflow for my blog over the past eight years.

In this lesson, I'll show you all the tools I use in the process of coming up with ideas, writing a first draft, editing, publishing, and sharing.

## What's not covered: Grammar

While I do love grammar and try to obey its sometimes maddening rules, this is not a course about grammar.

In lesson four, I'll cover some techniques to strengthen your writing and catch careless errors, but this course is more about connecting your writing with an audience rather than the craft of writing itself.

## Class schedule

The class will meet in one 90-minute session per week for six weeks.

I'm going to finalize the schedule once I get everyone's availability, but we'll meet either Wednesdays, Thursdays, or Fridays at 10am, 1pm, or 4pm ET.

## Class size

I'm aiming to have classes of 10-20 students. If there's enough demand, I may add additional sections so that no class gets uncomfortably large.

## Venue

The classes will meet online on Jitsi Meet. You don't need to be on camera during the class, but you're welcome to be.

## Structure

The classes will be lecture-style lessons.

I'll present slides for 30-60 minutes, and I'll reserve 20-30 minutes for questions.

## Who should take this course?

The type of writing that succeeds on Hacker News is from authors who write about technical topics like software and hardware or about running a business related to those domains.

This course is likely a good match for you if you fall in any of the following categories:

- You're interested in writing articles about software, hardware, or entrepreneurship.
- You've submitted articles to Hacker News in the past and can't understand why they didn't get attention when similar articles from other authors succeeded.
- You want to write articles to bring attention to your startup, side project, or small business.
- You work in DevRel and want to write content that will appeal to smart developers.

## Who shouldn't take this course?

If you're a marketer, influencer, VP, or "thought leader," who has lots of theories to share about what other people are doing without doing anything yourself, your writing probably won't succeed on Hacker News.

If you've become a LinkedIn sensation by writing [amazing broetry](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/why-are-these-posts-taking-over-your-linkedin-feed-because), I admit up front that I can't help you translate that skill to Hacker News.

## Requirements

There is no homework for this class, so most of the work is attending classes and actively participating.

Specifically, you need to:

- Show up: I want to teach people who are interested in all of the topics. I expect you to show up to at least five of the six sessions, preferably 100% of them.
- Give feedback: I'll send out surveys after each session asking for feedback. I'll use the feedback to guide the course material and teach in a way that best connects with you.

## Cost

The course is $180 per attendee ($30 per session).

I accept credit payment via PayPal or through cryptocurrency (ETH or USDC).

## Downloadable copy

Following the live course, I'll record a pre-recorded version covering the same material. It will be an updated version of [_Hit the Front Page of Hacker News_](https://hitthefrontpage.com/), which I published in 2020.

When I publish the full course, you'll get a free copy of the highest-tier package.

## Refund policy

If you decide after the first class that this course isn't right for you, I can offer a 100% refund. After that, I won't offer refunds for leaving the course.

## Heads up: Babies make things unpredictable

My wife and I are expecting our first child at the end of August.

The class is scheduled to end well before the due date, but if the baby arrives early, I'll need to cancel remaining classes. If that happens, I'll refund your tuition at $30 per session that was not fulfilled.

## Sign up

If you're interested in the class, sign up below and let me know which timeslots you're available. I'll finalize the schedule and send out payment links by 6pm ET on Monday, June 24th.
