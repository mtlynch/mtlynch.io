I've been in business since 2004. Ecommerce company. I sell goods online. Never had a lawsuit. Today, I received a random lawsuit in the mail that is filed in a court in Maryland. The plaintiff claims he doesn't like the email marketing I sent him because the email subjects might be "Misleading" and that he may not have signed up in the first place. (Despite not clicking the unsubscribe link for years)

Anyway -- I Google this schmuck, and realize he's an ex-attorney who was disbarred in 2014. Since he no longer has an attorney license, he goes around suing people personally to make money. He has sued dozens and dozens of small and large businesses... especially for telemarketing.

In my case, he's asking for $500 per email sent (Total $16,000) that my small business can't afford. It appears that he files lots of these lawsuits in hopes that some of them just settle since the cost of hiring an atorney alone is already $5000+ in today's world.

How do I handle this? It's basically a scam friviolous lawsuit from a guy who has filed dozens and dozens of the same lawsuit. Oddly, the guy is in a different state and suing me in HIS state. So I would need to hire an attorney in that state to even defend myself.

What would you do with this bullshit?
