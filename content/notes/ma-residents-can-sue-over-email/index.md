title: "Massachusetts Residents Can Sue Online Merchants for Spam"

Last week, I saw an interesting article on the /r/legaladvice subreddit. An ecommerce business owner was complaining that a customer was suing because the merchant had been sending the customer promotional emails for years that the customer never agreed to.

The merchant was upset and felt like it was a shakedown, but I was 100% on the customer's side. The merchant is in the wrong for spamming their customers with promotional emails they never requested, and they should see financial reprocussions.

## Promotional emails privatize profits and socialize costs

Promotional emails are a perfect example of businesses privatizing profits while socializing costs.

Suppose I buy a shirt from Bonobos. For me, that's the last I want to hear from Bonobos until I decide to buy something else. But Bonobos will undoubtedly decide to add me to their newsletter to encourage me to buy more from them.

And most customers are probably like me. Every promotional email they receive from Bonobos or any other merchant distracts them for 10-30 seconds. If Bonobos sends out 10 million emails per year, it costs consumers an aggregate of 3 years of wasted time to read and delete them.

But Bonobos doesn't care because Bonobos doesn't bear any of those costs. Bonobos pays a few hundred dollars to send those 10 million emails. In return, they probably get tens to hundreds of thousands in additional revenue because 1% of those emails worked and convinced people to purchase more products from Bonobos.

All the gains go to Bonobos, and almost all the costs go to the consumers who don't want to waste their time with Bonobos' promotional emails.

## Who's suing people for spam?

So, back to that reddit post. I wanted to know more about the case to see if I could start suing businesses who abused my email address. The only clues were:

- The plaintiff is a lawyer who was disbarred in 2014
- The plaintiff has a long, documented history of suing businesses for spam emails

I tried searching for it but couldn't find anyone. I ended up finding XX of DanHatesSpam. He's been suing businesses for spam for decades. It didn't sound like the same guy as the redddit post, but it gave me what I needed.

But it turned out that Dan is able to sue businesses because he's a resident of California. California has a law that mandates penalties for sending customers spam emails:

## Does Massachusetts have an equivalent privacy law to California's?

I hoped that my home state of Massachusetts might have a law like XX so I could exercise my rights with spammers like Dan does.

It turns out that Massachusetts _does_ have a law protecting consumers from spam, though it actually predates ecommerce. The law forbids merchants from requiring customers to provide more personal information than is necessary to complete payment.

## What does this mean for me

I'm going to see what happens if I do the following:

1. Record the checkout process when I buy something from an online merchant to capture the fact that I'm not opting in to promotional emails
1. If I receive a promotional email, solicitation of a review, or any kind of email other than what's strictly required to complete my purchase, I'll send the business a demand letter (TODO: link) telling them to send me a $25 penalty and that subsequent emails after they receive my letter will be $75 because at that point
1. If they don't respond or say they don't owe me money, take them to small claims court and cite XX law

I've never taken a business to small claims court, so part of it will just be interesting to see how the processs works. I'll update here as I proceed.
