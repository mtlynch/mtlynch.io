# Requirements

- Different from what I know
- Web-oriented
- Has testing tools
- Supports backend and frontend
  - It doesn't have to have a frontend framework, but I want to be able to use the same toolchain for backend and frontend like I can in Go or Python. In other words, I don't want to use something like Elm that's frontend-only.
- Open-source
- Actively-maintained

# Nice-to-haves

- There's a book
- Has native testing tools

# Candidates

## Elixir

## Gleam

## OCaml

## Clojure

## Haskell

## Ruby / Rails

## PHP / Laravel

Sounds elitist, but no.
