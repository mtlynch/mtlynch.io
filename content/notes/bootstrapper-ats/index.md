## JOIN

Seems fine. I'm suspicious of how they're making money since the platform doesn't charge employers.

It's not possible to test the applicant tracking functionality without publishing a real job posting, and the job postings require manual approval, so I didn't get to test out the applicant management functionality.

No way to add free-form questions.
