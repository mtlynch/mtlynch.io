title: "Applicant Tracking Systems for a Bootstrapped Business"

I'm a bootstrapped founder of [a small company](https://tinypilotkvm.com). I'm hiring for an open position soon, and I'm in the market for a system of tracking applications.

The last time I hired for a role, I posted the job on WeWorkRemotely and directed candidates to email me. I ended up [receiving 221 applications](/retrospectives/2022/03/#hiring-a-support-engineer-the-job-posting), so managing them in email became messy. I came up with a folder labeling system that worked okay, but this time around, I want a purpose-built tool for tracking applications.

These are my notes to summarize what applicant tracking systems I found and how good of a match they are for small, bootstrapped businesses.

## Criteria

### Requirements

- Shows me a view of candidates at each hiring stage
- Treats candidates respectfully
  - Doesn't force them to fill out the same information redundantly or jump through unnecessary hoops to apply
- Costs <= $300/month
- Publishes clear pricing
- Allows me to sign up without scheduling a demo

### Nice-to-haves

- Optimized for small businesses
  - Fewer features around team hiring and approvals that large businesses need
- Focuses on the applicant tracking part rather than trying to be an overall HR tool
- Allows me to pause billing between job openings
  - I typically only have one open position every few months, so I don't want to pay the standard monthly fee, but I don't want to have to start from scratch if I come back a few months later.

### Dealbreakers

- Mentions "AI-powered"

For pricing, I'm using the lowest tier plan that would fit my needs, which is to have one job opening and unlimited candidates. For companies that bill in Euros, I've converted to USD for convenience of comparing.

## [Homerun](https://www.homerun.co/)

Homerun had the best UX of any

At first, I thought Homerun's process for creating job listings was too complicated. By default, they drop you into a full-blown landing page builder with complicated layouts, when all I really wanted was a job description and initial questions. But it turns out that you can skip the landing page and just make the simple application. That's really nice, because it lets you delegate the job posting to other sites that specialize in it.

They sort of allow you to pause billing in that you can downgrade to the free tier when you're not actively hiring. I believe this forces you to delete all but your 100 most recent candidates, which is a bummer but not a dealbreaker.

## [Polymer](https://www.polymer.co/)

Monica Lent [recommended Polymer](https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1556716598605631489)

Two-person team.

## [Recruitee](https://recruitee.com)

## [Breezy](https://breezy.hr)

## [Hireproof](https://hireproof.io/)

Someone recommended Hireproof to me on Twitter, and I'm not quite sure it even is an applicant tracking system. Their signup page is deceptive in that at the end, you don't get access to the product but just get added to a waitlist.

The next day, I received an email inviting me to try the actual product. And after using it, I'm not sure what the app is, exactly. I don't want to be too critical since they're still in beta, but I had a lot of trouble navigating their application. They show me tons of UI controls with no indication of what I have to do next.

I gave up after ten minutes.

## [JOIN](https://join.com)

Seems fine. I'm suspicious of how they're making money since the platform doesn't charge employers.

It's not possible to test the applicant tracking functionality without publishing a real job posting, and the job postings require manual approval, so I didn't get to test out the applicant management functionality.

No way to add free-form questions.

## [Eddy](https://eddy.com/)

They don't allow self-service signups, so I didn't try it.

## [Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io/)

They don't allow self-service signups, so I didn't try it.

## [Lever](https://www.lever.co/)

They don't allow self-service signups, so I didn't try it.
