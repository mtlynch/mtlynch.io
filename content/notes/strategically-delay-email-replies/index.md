title: "Strategically Delay Email Replies"

When someone needs my help but they're sending me lazy questions, I delay my responses. If they're asking me one question at a time when they could be batching their questions, it's usually because I'm responding so fast that they feel like the fastest way to get answers is to ask me as soon as a question pops into their head. If they can expect a response within minutes, why put more effort into their questions or research the answers themselves? If I let an email sit for a day or however long is acceptable for the situation, then it changes the equation for the sender. Now, if they want to dribble out five questions one email at a time, it's going to take them a week to get their answers as opposed to just a few hours.

## Strategically delay your replies

What if you invest extra time into your emails to write thorough replies, but the person emailing you just keeps volleying back half-assed replies that push all the work onto you?

When I feel like someone is emailing me but not putting much thought into their writing, I deliberately defer my response for a bit.

To understand why this is effective, think about it from the other person's perspective. Imagine that they have questions about a product or API you own. They could research the questions themselves, which is ideal for you but costly for them. They could think through all of their questions upfront and present them clearly, which is, again, more costly for them. Or they could dribble out questions to you

When you receive half-baked emails, it's often because the person sending them is optimizing for their personal priorities. They're following the path of least resistance, and they either don't realize or don't care about imposing work on others.

If this person needs your help with a product you own or an API you maintain, and you consistently send excellent replies within a couple of hours, why would this person do anything else?

One way you can train people to send you more thoughtful emails is by delaying your replies. Even if you take the time to write complete emails, the person emailing you may not follow suit. They could just drip out one question at a time because they still just want to get a thread out of their inbox as quickly as possible.

Think about it from their perspective. They want to do the easiest thing for themselves. And if you consistently respond to all their questions within an hour, then the easiest thing for them to do is to use you as an email butler and push work onto your plate. So they know they can ask you one question at a time five times in a row and still get all their answers within one business day.

The calculus changes if you deliberately scale your latency from an hour to a day or two. Now, if they drip out questions one at a time, it will take them a week to get answers to five questions. At that point, dripping out emails starts to look less attractive.

At my last company, this technique was especially effective at making customer support manageable. I initially took pride in being the founder that responds within minutes to customer questions, but it quickly trained customers to email me anytime a question popped into their head, even if the question only tangentially involved my product. I found that slowing down my replies by a few hours trained customers to put more thought into their questions and often find answers independently.

One of the other issues with responding quickly to emails is that it trains people to think that you're their email butler. Any thought that pops into their head, they'll email it to you because they can rely on you to drop what you're doing and respond.

If you find that someone is relying on you for answers rather than putting in due diligence on their end, an effective way to discourage that is by delaying your replies. The allowable time to delay will vary depending on your relationship.

At my last company, I deliberately delayed customer service emails by a few hours. Even questions that had nothing to do with my product, they'd ask me.

Often, they'd .

But if they want their problem solved, now if they dribble questions out to you one at a time, they maybe have to wait a week to get this solved. If they want it solved today, they'll realize it's faster if they think of questions ahead of time and batch them together so that you can answer everything in one shot.
