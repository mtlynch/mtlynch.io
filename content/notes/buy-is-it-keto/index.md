## Stats for last six months

From January 1, 2024 until June 30, 2024, here are the key stats for the site:

- Unique visitors: 53k

- Revenue from Google AdSense: $947.51
- Revenue from Amazon Affiliate program: $139.30

## Tech stack

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Gridsome
  - Gridsome is a static site generator built on top of Vue2.
  - Gridsome is defunct, but the tool still builds the site without issue.
- CircleCI
  - Automatically runs linters and end-to-end tests on every commit.
  - Automatically builds and publishes site to Netlify on every commit to the main branch.

Gridsome is slow, but all of the content is in Markdown, so you can easily port it to another static site generator. It should be easy to port it to a more modern Vue-based static site generator like [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/). There are only \~2,000 lines of Vue code in the project.

### [Recipe Search](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org)

I used to have a keto recipe search site called KetoHub, but I never monetized it, so I merged it with Is It Keto.

- Angular 2
  - The code is, honestly, bad. I was never a good Angular developer.
- Python 2.7
  - The code for indexing and postprocessing other keto websites is in Python 2.7.

### Hosting

Both sites are static sites that you can host anywhere cheaply. I currently host
