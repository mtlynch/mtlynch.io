**Update (2024-07-12)**: I've received more inquiries than I expected, so I'm now closing applications.

I'm looking for someone to take over my old content website, [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org).

{{<img src="isitketo-homepage.png" max-width="700px" has-border="true" caption="[Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) is for sale">}}

I worked on the site [on and off between 2019 and 2020](/retrospectives/2020/07/), but I no longer have time for it, so it's just been neglected for the past several years. Still, it consistently earns $1-2k/yr in fully passive revenue.

## Stats for last six months

From January 1, 2024 until June 30, 2024, here are the key stats for the site:

- Unique visitors: 53k
- Total pageviews: 128k
- Revenue from Google AdSense: $947.51
- Revenue from Amazon Affiliate program: $139.30
- Total revenue (last six months): $1,086.81
  - $1,793.20 in last 12 months
- Ahrefs domain rating (current): 18

## Asking price

I'm looking for a minimum price of **$1k**.

This is below market value, as I'm more interested in selling the site to someone who wants to do something interesting with it.

## Ideal buyer

In short, I want to sell to someone who wants to continue building the site and doesn't require hand-holding.

I'd like to sell to someone who is:

- Interested in entrepreneurship.
- Comfortable working with JavaScript and HTML code, especially Vue 2.
- Interested in growing the site.
  - You don't have to make it your full-time job, but I'm hoping to sell to someone who wants to try new things with the site rather than just sit back and collect revenue.
- Bonus: You have a history of building in public.

I don't want to sell to someone who uses spammy tactics or deceives users for growth. A lot of other diet sites monetize by tricking users into purchasing snake oil, and I've always hated that.

I can't control what you do after you take over the site, but I'll give preference to buyers who have a track record of operating ethically.

## What's appealing about the business?

- It's a static site, so it's inexpensive to host.
  - It fits into the free tier of most static hosting platforms.
- As a static site, it's also low-maintenance, as there's no server or database to manage.
- All the build steps are already in CI, so there's no magic to learning to build the site.
- There's low-hanging fruit to increase the revenue, as I haven't updated Amazon affiliate links in years, and most pages are missing affiliate links entirely.

## What are the risks with the business?

- It's the kind of content that LLMs are trying to dominate.
  - It's possible that in a year, everyone will ask an LLM which foods are keto rather than use a website.
- The site is built on an obsolete JavaScript framework.
  - It will take a few hours of work to port the code to something more modern.
- The keto diet is [fading in popularity](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=keto&hl=en), so a keto diet site will shrink with it.

## Tech stack

- Gridsome / Vue2
  - Gridsome is a static site generator built on top of Vue2.
  - Gridsome is defunct, but the tool still builds the site without issue.
- CircleCI
  - Automatically runs linters and end-to-end tests on every commit.
  - Automatically builds and publishes site to Netlify on every commit to the main branch.

Gridsome is slow, but all of the content is in Markdown, so you can easily port it to another static site generator. It should be easy to port it to a more modern Vue-based static site generator like [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/). There are only \~2,000 lines of Vue code in the project.
