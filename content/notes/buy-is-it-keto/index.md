I'm looking for a buyer for Is It Keto.

I built the site for a

## Stats for last six months

- Total pageviews: 128k
- Revenue from Google AdSense: $947.51

## Ideal buyer

In short, I want to sell to someone who

I'd like to sell to someone who's:

- Interested in entrepreneurship.
- Comfortable working with JavaScript and HTML code, especially Vue 2.
- Comfortable building and maintaining a SPA-style web app using Node.js.
- Interested in growing the site.
  - You don't have to make it your full-time job, but I'm hoping to sell to someone who wants to try new things with the site rather than just sit back and collect revenue.
- Bonus: You have a history of building in public.

I don't want to sell to someone who uses spammy tactics or deceives users for growth. A lot of other diet sites monetize by tricking users into purchasing snake oil, and I've always hated that.

I can't control what you do after you take over the site, but I'll give preference to buyers who have a track record of operating ethically.

## What's appealing about the business?

- It's a static site, so it's inexpensive to host.
  - It fits into the free tier of most static hosting platforms.

## What are the risks with the business?

## Tech stack

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Gridsome / Vue2
  - Gridsome is a static site generator built on top of Vue2.
  - Gridsome is defunct, but the tool still builds the site without issue.
- CircleCI
  - Automatically runs linters and end-to-end tests on every commit.
  - Automatically builds and publishes site to Netlify on every commit to the main branch.

Gridsome is slow, but all of the content is in Markdown, so you can easily port it to another static site generator. It should be easy to port it to a more modern Vue-based static site generator like [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/). There are only \~2,000 lines of Vue code in the project.

### [Keto Recipe Search](https://recipe-search.isitketo.org)

I used to have a keto recipe search site called KetoHub, but I never monetized it, so I merged it with Is It Keto.

- Angular 2
  - The code is, honestly, bad. I was never a good Angular developer.
- Python 2.7
  - The code for indexing and postprocessing other keto websites is in Python 2.7.

### Hosting

Both sites are static sites that you can host anywhere cheaply. I currently host Is It Keto on Netlify and host Keto Recipe Search on Firebase Hosting.
