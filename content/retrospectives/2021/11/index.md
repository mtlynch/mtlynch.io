## Highlights

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Train local staff members to assist with customer support

* **Result**: Local staff members are answering ~50% of support emails
* **Grade**: A-

We now have a shared support queue using [HelpScout](https://www.helpscout.com/). There are still a lot of support requests that I have to handle personally because nobody else has the context and technical background yet, but it's great to have help on about half the requests.

### Start development on a monthly service-based software complement to TinyPilot

* **Result**: Paused development after a tepid user reception
* **Grade**: C-

I [published a preview](https://tinypilotkvm.com/blog/tinypilot-cloud-waitlist) of a service called TinyPilot Cloud and offered signups for early access. There wasn't enough interest from users, so I've paused the project for now.

### Complete TinyPilot's website rebrand

* **Result**: We're very close, but it's not done yet.
* **Grade**: B-

The rebrand is taking longer than expected, but I expect to have it completed this month. I'm excited about the website's new look.

## The TinyPilot Cloud flop

## Simplifying to just one product

## Taking a test vacation

The person who [expressed interest in acquiring Zestful](/retrospectives/2021/09/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom) stopped following up and hasn't replied to my emails, so that's no longer in play.
