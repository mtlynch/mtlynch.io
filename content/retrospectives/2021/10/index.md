## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

* **Result**: Made progress but didn't publish a chapter

### Start development on a monthly service-based software complement to TinyPilot

* **Result**: XX
* **Grade**: B-

TODO

### Finalize the design of the Voyager 2

* **Result**: XX
