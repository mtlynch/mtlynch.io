## Highlights

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish a sample chapter of [*Refactoring English*](https://refactoringenglish.com)

* **Result**: Made progress but didn't publish a chapter
* **Grade**: D

TinyPilot got busy enough again that I didn't have much time to write this month, so I'm not sure when I'll be able to pick up the book again.

### Start development on a monthly service-based software complement to TinyPilot

* **Result**: XX
* **Grade**: B-

TODO

### Finalize the design of the Voyager 2

* **Result**: XX
* **Grade**: A

\* Royalties are an estimate until my distributor and I calculate the totals.<br>
\*\* Profit is provisional until I complete my monthly bookkeeping. Currently, it's just the delta in my cash for the month minus my credit card balance.

After an unremarkable first half of the month, I got a surprise review from Jeff Geerling, a beloved blogger and YouTube creator in the Raspberry Pi world. He made a video that compared TinyPilot to PiKVM, and I feel like both products came across well.

## PiKVM's scary fundraising

When I was developing TinyPilot, the maintainer of . At the time, Pi KVM was one of several Raspberry Pi KVM over IP projects, and I felt they were limiting their audience by requiring so much electronics background and

My advantages are still:

**Assembling a dev team**: Even with unlimited money, it's still difficult and time-consuming to find and hire talented developers.

**Learnable codebase**: TinyPilot has extensive unit tests, continuous integration, and documentation that make it easy for new developers to work on the code. Only one person is comfortable with the PiKVM codebase, and that's the founder. There's a 500-fold difference between PiKVM's founder and the next most prolific contributor. For TinyPilot, I only have 2x as much code as the next most active contributor and only 10x more than the one after that.

**Assembly workflow**: For anyone to compete with TinyPilot by building a pre-assembled device, they'd need to hire and train staff to do this. This isn't trivial, and it took me several months to fully delegate. PiKVM is cutting out some complexity by delegating order fulfillment to another company, but that only works for products that don't require any assembly or functional testing.

## Investing more into marketing

I didn't have development bandwidth. I didn't want to

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

Is It Keto seems to be slowly dying. Another website popped up that does the same thing as Is It Keto, but they're actively building it, so they're outcompeting me in search engine rankings. I was hoping to quietly collect passive income on it indefinitely, but it's been deflating fast each month.

In August, I ran a pay-what-you-want promotion for the course, and that led to a jump in sales. I worried that anyone who would ever consider the course had already purchased it during that promotion, but September showed that a handful of people are still buying.

Zestful is popping up from nowhere as a recurring revenue source. Historically, the service only made money from companies that wanted the Enterprise version for a month or two to bulk process millions of records. The pay-as-you-go service never earned much money. In the last three months, multiple customers are increasing their usage of Zestful to the point that it's generating a few hundred dollars per month in usage fees.
