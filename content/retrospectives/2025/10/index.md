**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and founder of small, indie tech businesses. I'm currently working on a book called [_Refactoring English: Effective Writing for Software Developers_](https://refactoringenglish.com).

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my book and my professional life overall.

## Highlights

-

## Goal grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish something that attracts new readers to the _Refactoring English_ website

- **Result**: Published ["The Software Essays that Shaped Me"](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/software-essays-that-shaped-me/), which attracted 16k readers in the first three days
- **Grade**: B+

TODO

### Publish a new chapter of _Refactoring English_

- **Result**: Didn't publish anything new
- **Grade**: F

I wrote a first draft of a new chapter, but I didn't end up publishing it. I ended up spending more time than I planned on "The Software Essays that Shaped Me" and freelance editing clients.

### Write personalized emails to 20 readers I haven't spoken to before

- **Result**: Emailed two new readers
- **Grade**: D

I was going to write this off and say that I'm not learning anything anymore by reaching out to customers. Then, a few days ago, a reader I reached out to in August followed up to say he used what he learned from my book to get an article on the front page of Hacker News for the first time. So, that was pretty indisputably valuable and tells me I should be doing more of this.

## Experimenting with bunts

In baseball, a bunt is when you hit the ball by just holding the bat in the ball's path rather than swinging. The upside is that you're less likely to miss, but the downside is that you won't hit the ball very far. The best you can hope for with a bunt is making it to first base, but a bunt is almost never going to be a homerun.

Most of my blog posts are "swing for the fences" type posts where I'm trying for a homerun. I'm putting in a lot of effort because I'm hoping to reach #1 on Hacker News, reddit, or search results.

The problem is that my "swing for the fences" posts take me about a month to write, so if I'm publishing blog posts as I write my book, I'd have to put my book on hold for a month every time I write a blog post. I've been thinking about whether I could do some "bunt" posts instead. That way, I can only put my book on hold for a week rather than the whole month.

I don't want to take a topic that deserves a lot of effort and just do a low-effort version of it. Rather, I want to take a topic that's easy to cover and just see how it does.

My first bunt was ["I Once Appeared in The Old New Thing."](/my-old-new-thing-cameo/) It was about an experience I had when I was 22 and working at my first real job at Microsoft. I didn't have a lot of insightful things to say about it, but I thought it was an interesting story. I was able to write it in about four hours, and it felt complete.

My next bunt was ["The Software Essays that Shaped Me."](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/software-essays-that-shaped-me/) I've seen other people share lists of their favorite software blog posts, and I thought it would be an easy, fun thing to do. Best of all, I felt like the people who appreciate good software writing would also find my book interesting.

As I started to write "The Software Essays that Shaped Me," it turned into more than just a bunt. I ended up spending almost my entire writing time in September on it.

I originally thought I'd list my favorite blog posts and call it a day, but that felt too boring. So, I tried to write a bit of commentary about each, but then I got carried away and ended up writing commentary that was longer than the originals themselves, in some cases. It took me several drafts before I found a way to write about these posts that felt interesting, and I still don't feel like I quite succeeded.

I think it's interesting to people who know me. If someone whose work I liked published a list of the articles that influenced them, I'd find that interesting. But seeing random lists of blog posts: not so interesting.

I posted it and then people started sharing their lists of essays that were important to them, and I had no interest in reading them. Granted, a lot of people just shared links without any context, and I put a lot more effort into pitching my resources, but I still feel like it's

Previously, when I had posts do well on Hacker News, a noticeable portion of readers [purchased the book](/my-6k-advance/#publishing-book-excerpts). This time, only one person purchased. Maybe everyone seeing it on Hacker News has already seen that I'm writing the book, so everyone who's interested has already bought?

I woke up the morning after it had already fallen off the front page of Hacker News and suddenly realized: I never included the ad for the book!

All the sample chapters on the book's website include a little self-ad to tell the reader I'm writing a book on this topic, and they can buy early access.

I forgot to include the self-ad for the blog post, so the first 14k readers saw my post and had no idea I'm writing a book about this.

## Adjusting my approach to freelance editing

A few months ago, I decided to offer freelance editing services to help other developers improve writing on their blogs. My idea was that it's an opportunity to make sure the way I explain concepts in my book makes sense to real people.

At the beginning, freelance editing gave me good ideas for my book, but as I do more jobs, I'm getting fewer ideas for my book. I feel like a lot of the feedback I write is basically rewriting things I've already written for my book.

There's also a pretty high cost to the editing. Each job takes me between four to seven hours, and it eats up my "hard thinking" of the day, so it's hard for me to do my own writing in the same day. I also feel a time pressure, even though nobody has asked me to hurry. But just knowing my own writing process, it sucks to have gates where you're stuck for days waiting for feedback.

So, what I really wanted is some way to keep doing the editing, but _only_ for people who have read the book. I've doubled my normal rates for everyone, but I'm planning to email book customers and say that they get 90% off the listed rates if they pinky promise that they've read everything I've published so far and accompany their draft with a one-page addendum explaining what they were able to apply to their writing and what they didn't understand or struggled to put into practice.

I don't care that much about the money because I hope that whatever I could charge in the short term would be insignificant relative to what I'd make long-term from writing a better book. But there's value in clients paying so that they feel like they have skin in the game, too.

I also find that once I start reading a draft, there are questions that I wish I'd asked the developer beforehand, so I need to adjust my process to include these questions up front:

- Who is the audience for this post?
  - e.g., beginner Python developers, mid-level tech managers
- What benefit does the reader get from reading the post?
  - e.g., learn a new technique, enjoy a fun rant
- What level of technical expertise is required to read this post?
  - What terms and concepts should the reader understand to be a good match for this post?
  - What terms and concepts in the post do you expect to be unfamiliar to the reader?

## Why do I keep skipping out on reader outreach?

I keep setting this goal and missing, and I'm not sure why. On its face, it doesn't seem that hard, but it never seems like the most important thing, so I keep deferring it.

There are other tasks I procrastinate because I don't enjoy doing it, but I actually do enjoy reaching out to readers. It's fun to see what different readers are up to and how they might apply my techniques.

Emailing readers also requires a lot of activation energy because I have to:

1. Go to my list of pre-paid readers
1. Look for ones that have a website (so I can say something personalized)
1. Read through their website to learn more about them
1. Write an email and word it carefully to avoid sounding AI-generated

This is the third time I've set this goal and missed by a large margin, so I'm going to try just setting a lower goal. I'm also going to try to reduce the activation energy by first gathering a list of customers to email and their websites. That way, when I'm in the mood to reach out, so I'm not starting from scratch every time.

## The hassle of sending post-purchase emails with Stripe

A few _Refactoring English_ customers have emailed me confused because they paid but never got an email with a link to the book. I collect payment through Stripe, and Stripe redirects customers to the book's URL after they complete payment or don't notice the redirect, they lose access to the book.

Whenever I get these emails, I dig around in Stripe to look for a setting to customize the emails, give up after a few minutes, and then just email the correct link to the customer.

Last month, I finally sat down and searched through Stripe's documentation and forum posts, and I can't find any way to customize the email Stripe sends after a customer completes a one-time payment. As far as I can tell, the only option is to spin up your own web server to listen for Stripe webhooks, then send your own emails from your own email provider. All because Stripe can't be bothered to let merchants customize any text in the payment completion emails...

Setting up a web server to respond to web hooks isn't _that_ hard, but it's a much bigger hassle than I'd like. I decided to do it with Netlify functions, which I've never used before.

I was originally going to send the emails with Postmark. I've [done that on other projects](https://github.com/mtlynch/screenjournal/tree/ef234562c4157cebcb41d3d2647ca20678444da4/email), but it takes a surprising amount of Go code to send emails with SMTP. And then even doing a minimal amount of text formatting is another layer of complexity. I've also been less enthusiastic about Postmark since it was sold from Wildbit (a company I admire) to ActiveCampaign (a spam company).

I decided partway into coding it that it's simpler if I automatically add the customer to Buttondown, my mailing list manager, and then I set up Buttondown to automatically send users a post-purchase email when I add them to the list. That way, I'm outsourcing the email design, formatting, and sending to Buttondown. It keeps my webhook simple because all it has to do is receive a notification from Stripe, verify it's for the right product, and then POST a request to Buttondown to add the user to the list. I'd been wanting to set up something to automatically sync to Buttondown anyway so that all customers get new chapter announcements.

But I still feel like it's silly that Stripe doesn't let me just customize my post-purchase emails...

## Side projects

### Breaking down Hacker News success by the hour

I initially thought I had a bug that overcounted the success rate, as the percentage of Hacker News submissions that reach the front page feels lower than 12% in my experience. But then I looked at some random slices from the last few days, and it seems to match up. If I browse `/newest`, there will typically be 2-5 stories that reached the front page. I found [a 30-minute slice from a few days ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest?next=45440276&n=1081) where 27% of submissions reached the front page, which is surprising.

I thought that success rate would be significantly higher on the weekends, when there are fewer submissions. Weekend posts are more likely to reach the front page, but the effect is much smaller than I thought.

- Weekdays: 12.0% of submissions reach the front page.
- Weekdends: 13.7% of submissions reach the front page.

I thought it was going to be like 5% on weekdays vs. 20% on weekends. It makes submitting on the weekend less attractive because there are substantially fewer readers, and you only have a small increase in chance to reach the front page.

I'd like to try limiting the data to personal blogs [like I do on HN Popularity Contest](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/methodology/), as I'm curious to see if personal blogs have better chances at certain times.
