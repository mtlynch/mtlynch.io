**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and founder of small, indie tech businesses. I'm currently working on a book called [_Refactoring English: Effective Writing for Software Developers_](https://refactoringenglish.com).

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my book and my professional life overall.

{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

-

## Goal grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish something that attracts new readers to the _Refactoring English_ website

- **Result**: Published ["The Software Essays that Shaped Me"](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/software-essays-that-shaped-me/), which attracted 16k readers in the first three days
- **Grade**: B+

TODO

### Publish a new chapter of _Refactoring English_

- **Result**: Didn't publish anything new
- **Grade**: F

I wrote a first draft of a new chapter, but I didn't end up publishing it. I ended up spending more time than I planned on "The Software Essays that Shaped Me" and freelance editing clients.

### Write personalized emails to 20 readers I haven't spoken to before

- **Result**: Emailed two new readers
- **Grade**: D

I was going to write this off and say that I'm not learning anything anymore by reaching out to customers. Then, a few days ago, a reader I reached out to in August followed up to say he used what he learned from my book to get an article on the front page of Hacker News for the first time. So, that was pretty indisputably valuable and tells me I should be doing more of this.

## Experimenting with bunts

In baseball, a bunt is when you hit the ball by just holding the bat in the ball's path rather than swinging. The upside is that you're less likely to miss, but the downside is that you won't hit the ball very far. The best you can hope for with a bunt is making it to first base, but a bunt is almost never going to be a homerun.

Most of my blog posts are "swing for the fences" type posts where I'm trying for a homerun. I'm putting in a lot of effort because I'm hoping to reach #1 on Hacker News, reddit, or search results.

The problem is that my "swing for the fences" posts take me about a month to write, so if I'm publishing blog posts as I write my book, I'd have to put my book on hold for a month every time I write a blog post. I've been thinking about whether I could do some "bunt" posts instead. That way, I can only put my book on hold for a week rather than the whole month.

I don't want to take a topic that deserves a lot of effort and just do a low-effort version of it. Rather, I want to take a topic that's easy to cover and just see how it does.

My first bunt was ["I Once Appeared in The Old New Thing."](/my-old-new-thing-cameo/) It was about an experience I had when I was 22 and working at my first real job at Microsoft. I didn't have a lot of insightful things to say about it, but I thought it was an interesting story. I was able to write it in about four hours, and it felt complete.

My next bunt was ["The Software Essays that Shaped Me."](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/software-essays-that-shaped-me/) I've seen other people share lists of their favorite software blog posts, and I thought it would be an easy, fun thing to do. Best of all, I felt like the people who appreciate good software writing would also find my book interesting.

As I started to write "The Software Essays that Shaped Me," it turned into more than just a bunt. I ended up spending almost my entire writing time in September on it.

I originally thought I'd list my favorite blog posts and call it a day, but that felt too boring. So, I tried to include short commentary about each, but then I got carried away and ended up writing commentary that was longer than the originals themselves. It took me several drafts to figure out what commentary felt interesting, and I still don't feel like I quite succeeded.

I ended up spending 17 hours on "The Software Essays that Shaped Me" and never stopped to evaluate whether it was still worth writing if it was going to be all that work.

I think the post is interesting to people who know me or reads my blog. If someone whose work I liked published a list of the articles that influenced them, I'd find that interesting. But I noticed in comment threads about the post, some people would share their lists, and I found the lists of strangers totally uninteresting. Maybe I counteracted that some by investing a lot in my commentary, but

The posts did well. They both reached the front page of Hacker News, though they did it through the [second chance pool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26998308), which feels a little like winning through TKO rather than a real knockout.

### Screwing up my self-ad

Previously, when one of my _Refactoring English_ posts did well on Hacker News, a noticeable portion of readers [purchased the book](/my-6k-advance/#publishing-book-excerpts). This time, only one person purchased. Maybe everyone seeing it on Hacker News has already seen that I'm writing the book, so everyone who's interested has already bought?

I woke up the morning after it had already fallen off the front page of Hacker News and suddenly realized: I never included the ad for the book!

All the sample chapters on the book's website include a little self-ad to tell the reader I'm writing a book on this topic, and they can buy early access.

{{<img src="self-blurb.webp" max-width="700px" caption="All the pages on the *Refactoring English* are supposed to have a little self-ad on them for the book.">}}

I forgot to include the self-ad for the blog post, so the first 14k readers saw my post and had no idea I'm writing a book about this. D'oh! Lesson learned, but I updated my template so that it's something I can't possibly forget in the future.

## Adjusting my approach to freelance editing

A few months ago, I decided to offer freelance editing services to help other developers improve writing on their blogs. My idea was that it's an opportunity to make sure the way I explain concepts in my book makes sense to real people.

The downside is that there's a high cost to the editing. Each job takes me between four to seven hours, and it eats up my "hard thinking" of the day, so it's hard for me to do my own writing in the same day. I also feel a time pressure, even though nobody has asked me to hurry. But just knowing my own writing process, it sucks to have gates where you're stuck for days waiting for feedback.

At the beginning, freelance editing worked as I planned, as it gave me good ideas for my book. As I do more jobs, I'm getting fewer ideas for my book. I feel like a lot of the feedback I write is basically writing an individualized version of something I've already written for my book.

I want to keep doing the editing, but _only_ for authors who have read my book. I doubled my rates, so now my price for editing a blog post is $400. But I'm going to offer a 90% discount to readers who have read my book. Or, at least, everything I've published that's relevant to their writing, so they can skip the chapters on emails or commit messages if they want if they're showing me a blog post.

At 90% discount, it's basically free, but I want clients to pay _some_ amount so that they feel like they have skin in the game, too.

The idea of doubling my rate is that I want to find a price where I'm going to feel happy doing the work even if it distracts me from my book. $400 might still be too low, but we'll see.

## Why do I keep skipping out on reader outreach?

I'm trying to figure out why I keep missing my goal of reader outreach. On its face, it doesn't seem that hard, but it never seems like the most important thing, so I keep deferring it.

There are other tasks I procrastinate because I don't enjoy doing it, but I actually enjoy reaching out to readers. It's fun to see what different readers are up to and how they might apply my techniques.

Part of the issue is that emailing readers requires activation energy because I have to:

1. Go to my list of pre-paid readers
1. Look for ones that have a website (so I can say something personalized)
1. Read through their website to learn more about them
1. Write an email and word it carefully to avoid sounding AI-generated

It might help if I first gather a list of customers to email and their websites. That way, when I'm in the mood to reach out, I'm not starting from scratch every time.

## The hassle of sending post-purchase emails with Stripe

A few _Refactoring English_ customers have emailed me confused because they paid but never got an email with a link to the book. I collect payment through Stripe, and Stripe redirects customers to the book's URL after they complete payment or don't notice the redirect, they lose access to the book.

Whenever customers tell me they can't find the link to the book, I dig around in Stripe to look for a setting to customize post-purchase emails, give up after a few minutes, and then just email the correct link to the customer.

Last month, I finally sat down and searched through Stripe's documentation and forum posts, and I can't find any way to customize the email Stripe sends after a customer completes a one-time payment. As far as I can tell, the only option is to spin up your own web server to listen for Stripe webhooks, then send your own emails from your own email provider. All because Stripe can't be bothered to let merchants customize any text in the payment completion emails...

Setting up a web server to respond to web hooks isn't _that_ hard, but it's a much bigger hassle than I'd like. I decided to do it with Netlify functions, which I've never used before.

I was originally going to send the emails with Postmark. I've [done that on other projects](https://github.com/mtlynch/screenjournal/tree/ef234562c4157cebcb41d3d2647ca20678444da4/email), but it takes a surprising amount of Go code to send emails to an SMTP server. And then any email formatting or design is another layer of complexity. I've also been less enthusiastic about Postmark since it was sold from Wildbit (a company I admire) to ActiveCampaign (a spam company).

I decided partway into coding it that it's simpler if I automatically add the customer to Buttondown, my mailing list manager, and then I use [Buttondown automations](https://docs.buttondown.com/automations-introduction) to send readers a post-purchase email. That way, I'm outsourcing the email design, formatting, and sending to Buttondown. It keeps my webhook simple because all it has to do is receive a notification from Stripe, verify it's for the right product, and then POST a request to Buttondown to add the user to the list.

The other benefit of offloading the work to Buttondown is that I'd already wanted to set up a workflow that auto-adds early access customers to my early access mailing list on Buttondown. I've so far just been manually copying over new readers before each email. So, this post-purchase email automation kills too birds with one stone.

## Side projects

### Breaking down Hacker News success by the hour

I initially thought I had a bug that overcounted the success rate, as the percentage of Hacker News submissions that reach the front page feels lower than 12% in my experience. But then I looked at some random slices from the last few days, and it seems to match up. If I browse `/newest`, there will typically be 2-5 stories that reached the front page. I found [a 30-minute slice from a few days ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest?next=45440276&n=1081) where 27% of submissions reached the front page, which is surprising.

{{<img src="hourly-aggregates.webp" max-width="800px" caption="I created a view in Hacker News observer to show front page stats by hour">}}

I thought that success rate would be significantly higher on the weekends, when there are fewer submissions. Weekend posts are more likely to reach the front page, but the effect is much smaller than I thought.

- Weekdays: 12.1% of submissions reach the front page.
- Weekdends: 13.2% of submissions reach the front page.

I thought it was going to be like 5% on weekdays vs. 20% on weekends. It makes submitting on the weekend less attractive because there are substantially fewer readers, and you only have a small increase in chance to reach the front page.

I'd like to try limiting the data to personal blogs [like I do on HN Popularity Contest](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/methodology/), as I'm curious to see if personal blogs have better chances at certain times.
