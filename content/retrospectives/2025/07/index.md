## Goal grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Offer a lower-friction way for users to pre-order my book

- **Result**: Switched to Stripe payment links
- **Grade**: XX

7 customers in May via Kickstarter vs. 21 (ending in tdmack on Jul 2)

### Publish a new sample chapter on the book website

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### - Meet at least 10 readers on video calls

- **Result**: Met three readers on video calls.
- **Grade**: D

## How can I juggle fewer drafts at once?

One of the strategies that's been successful for this book is committing to at least an hour per day of "difficult" writing. That means that I can't use the hour to do formatting, grammar checking, or proofreading.

My strategy has worked well, and I probably published more in June I've ever published in any other month. I added three new chapters to the _Refactoring English_ ebook, published [one new sample chapter](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/release-announcements/), and I wrote [three](/goharddrive-leak/) [new](/notes/gleam-first-impressions/) [posts](/notes/gleam-call-elixir/) on this blog.

The problem with my strategy is that when I forbid myself from doing the non-hard writing tasks during my reserved writing hour, sometimes, I end up just not having time for those tasks the rest of the day, and they don't happen. So, also in June, I had a lot of partially-finished writing, and I felt like I was wasting mental cycles

## How can I attract new readers?

- Improve the website.
  - Add a favicon.
  - Tweak the UI so that the call-to-action is to buy early access rather than sign up for the mailing list.
  - Improve the early access page.
    - I've already rebranded it from "pre-order" to "early access."
    - Show prospective readers which chapters are complete and available.
- Offer custom presentations - book me for your team.
- Publish the interview with a blogger I recorded a year ago.
- Identify people who keep unsuccessfully submitting to Hacker News.

## Parsing old AIM logs with Gleam

One of the hardest things I'm finding is working without loops. Gleam deliberately has no loops. Instead, you're supposed to use recursive functions or call a mapping function for each element in the loop.

A lot of the limitations of Gleam, I find that it's interesting to do it the Gleam way. But without loops, I feel like it's just harder with no real upside.

I want to keep experimenting with Gleam, but I'm also feeling like I might end up switching to Elixir or OCaml, as they have a lot of the features I like in Gleam while addressing some of my pain points.
