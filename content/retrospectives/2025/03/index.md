## Kickstarter: I'm pleasantly surprised

I decided to do the pre-order for _Refactoring English_ on Kickstarter. I'd never used Kickstarter before, and I was bracing myself for it to be a miserable experience where I feel like they're trying to squeeze money out of me and don't care if my campaign succeds, but I found it surprisingly pleasant.

I've tried platforms that are ostensibly "creator-oriented," but then it quickly feels like the platform is working against me. Like the only way to use it is to pay for all these upgrades that have no guarantee of returning the investment.

All in all, it took me six to eight hours of work to fill out all the paperwork, verify my banking information, and create the public-facing text, video, and images.

With Kickstarter, I kept waiting for the upsells or the red tape, but it never came. I launched the project smoothly. The whole time, Kickstarter felt like they were on my side rather than trying to squeeze money out of me.

The one downside is spam. A ton of spammers must watch Kickstarter because as soon as my project launched, I started getting ten new emails per week from people offering some scammy way to help my campaign succeed. Irritatingly, they start the conversation with a seemingly innocuous question about the book, then transition into telling me that they also raise money on Kickstarter, and they're so glad they used company X, which they're eager to put me in touch with.

Your experience and success in blogging are impressive! Iâ€™d love to support the project. How do you plan to tailor the writing techniques for developers with varying levels of experience and expertise? Best regards, David">}}

### Requests for help

I'm looking for suggestions about what to host on my free 4x ARM CPU / 24 GB RAM Oracle Cloud server.

I [deployed a NixOS server to mine](/notes/nix-oracle-cloud/), and I used it to host a [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) service for some hobby projects, but the server is about 99% idle. I added a [Snowflake proxy](https://snowflake.torproject.org/) to help people defeat censorship, but that still doesn't consume much.

My criteria are:

- I'd like it to be something that's kind of fun like SETI@home was, where there's neat visual feedback about what you're doing.
- It's open-source.
- It's useful for a cause I think is neat.
- Oracle can blow away my server, and it shouldn't impact anyone.
  - i.e., I don't want anyone to lose data that they're storing on my server.
- I don't want to spend time moderating something.
- I don't want to mine cryptocurrency.

If you have suggestions, let me know in the comments or shoot me an email.
