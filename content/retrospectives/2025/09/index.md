**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and founder of small, indie tech businesses. I'm currently working on a book called [_Refactoring English: Effective Writing for Software Developers_](https://refactoringenglish.com).

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my book and my professional life overall.
