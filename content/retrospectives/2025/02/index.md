## Highlights

## Goal grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish my 2024 [annual review](/tags/annual-review/) blog post

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Finish another chapter of my book

- **Result**: Published ["Passive Voice Considered Harmful"](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/passive-voice-considered-harmful/) and an accompanying [interactive exercise](https://refactoringenglish.com/exercises/recognize-passive-voice/).
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Revise my tutorials chapter based on reader feedback

- **Result**: Added a new section, ["Use unambiguous example values."](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/#use-unambiguous-example-values)
- **Grade**: A

I made some line-level fixes based on reader suggestions, but the biggest revision was adding a new section. A few people had wished for guidance on using useful dummy data in examples, and I agreed that it belonged in the article.

## Is it stupid to write a book during an AI revolution?

I think it's clear that AI is causing a revolution in software development.

AI models now [operate at the skill level of a junior engineer with a computer science degree](/notes/cline-is-mesmerizing/). At the pace they're going, AI will outperform even the best humans at programming within two years.

The closest parallel in my lifetime is the shift from desktop software to the Internet and the web.

I just sold my last company, and I can do whatever I want. Should I be sitting this revolution out?

## Is there even a market for this book?

The other issue is that writing a book is a long commitment, and I don't yet have confidence that people want to read this book.

The chatpers on tutorials are easy to drop into, but chapters like "Passive voice considered harmful," I fear is more of an "eat your vegetables" chapter. I don't know that people are that excited to take time out of their day to read about the passive voice.

## Late to the game: RSS is great

RSS has been around for XX years, but I never got into RSS readers. I tried Google Reader back in XX, but I didn't have enough of a critical mass of interesting or new articles in my feed, so I just stopped checking and forgot about it.

In the past few years, a few things have happened to make RSS feeds more appealing:

- The tech people I used to follow on Twitter have all fragmented to different spaces.
- I've become more aware of social media amplifying attention-grabbing posts over technically interesting posts.
- I switched to NixOS as my OS, which makes it easy to self-host [a free, open-source RSS reader](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion).
- As AI slop is taking over the web, I want to follow particular people that I like.

So, I installed [the fusion RSS aggregator](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion) on my system, and I feel silly I didn't start doing this earlier. It's a nice way to find interesting articles, and I don't have to wait on reddit or Hacker News to surface them to me.

I used to subscribe by email to a few blogs, but this is better because I don't really want to receive an email every time there's a new blog post available.
