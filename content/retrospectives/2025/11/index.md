**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and founder of small, indie tech businesses. I'm currently working on a book called [_Refactoring English: Effective Writing for Software Developers_](https://refactoringenglish.com).

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my book and my professional life overall.

## Topic 1

## Topic 2

## Topic 3

## Side projects

### The v2 doesn't mean

### _Oxygen Not Included_ is fun

It's been on my mind for almost a year since I saw [Andrew Kelly and Mitchell Hashimoto talking about it](https://phanpy.social/#/mastodon.social/s/113602735590180420)

- It's pretty fun!
- The biggest problem is that it's pretty difficult to learn, as it's not obvious how to use most of the objects in the game.
