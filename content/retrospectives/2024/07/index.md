## Rebooting Hit the Front Page

In 2020, I created a video course about blogging called ["Hit the Front Page of Hacker News."](https://hitthefrontpage.com/) I was proud of the course material, and I heard positive feedback about it, but I felt swamped at the time. TinyPilot was growing quickly, and I didn't have much time to spare.

Over the last four years, I've made about $10k from sales of the course, but I always felt like I didn't give the course enough attention. I barely did any marketing for it after I launched, and I suspect there are a lot of marketing channels that would be a good match.

In [my last blog post](/i-sold-tinypilot/), I surveyed readers about what they'd like to see me do next.
