**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $80-100k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

-

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Complete design work for TinyPilot license checking

- **Result**: The design document is finished and reviewed.
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Create a process for spot-checking each manufacturing batch of new devices

- **Result**: I didn't do this.
- **Grade**: F

This is partially due to time constraints. I had to unexpectedly work around a few issues with our vendors, and that took up a bit of my time.

The other issue is that this is an unpleasant task, so I procrastinated it a lot. It's an important thing to do because we want to catch manufacturing errors early, but it requires making an ask of our 3PL, who historically hasn't been so cooperative when we ask them to do things outside of the standard day-to-day work of fulfilling orders.

### Handle TinyPilot's end-of-year tax chores

- **Result**: We collected W-9 forms from all of our vendors.
- **Grade**: A-

This is now complete, and I now have a better understanding of who needs to give us W-9 forms, so I can avoid making it a last-minute thing in the future.

Revenue is down slightly from November, but that's a seasonal trend that happens every year. The

Profit looks scary because I'm still doing bookkeeping on a cash basis even though we're spending a lot more on manufacturing up front due to shifting to a third-party contract manufacturer. In the fourth quarter, TinyPilot spent $150k on materials and manufacturing, the most we've ever spent in a quarter. On a cost of goods sold (COGS) basis, TinyPilot's profit for December was actually $9k (as in, positive $9k).

Still, I've been neglecting marketing as I focus on managing our transition to external manufacturing and fulfillment vendors. TinyPilot has fortunately grown without much investment in marketing the past few months, but I can't bank on that forever, so one of my goals in January is to explore some new marketing channels.

## Can I delegate hard product decisions?

When I think about where my time is going these days, I spend a large portion of it on what I'd call "hard product decisions." This is the time I spend thinking about which features TinyPilot needs, how much to invest in them, and how to reprioritize when we run into surprises.

I've tried to delegate more hard product decisons to the TinyPilot team, but I haven't made much progress.

It would be great if I could simply create a chart showing how much a feature costs vs. how much it will satisfy users, draw a curve showing what a good tradeoff looks like, and then tell the team to stay above the line.

{{<img src="csat-v-dev-cost.webp" max-width="600px" has-border="true" caption="I wish I could just define a curve of customer satisfaction vs. development cost and advise the team to just stay above the curve.">}}

But there are many more factors for deciding how much to invest in a new feature, including:

- Will this feature cause confusion / clutter for users who don't need it?
- What will the long-term burden be of maintaining this feature?
- How will this feature impact our support teams?

And even if I could create this multidimensional chart, it's hard to make meaningful estimates about all the variables. One person might think that 5% of users will benefit from a feature, while another equally intelligent teammate might guess that it's 15%. How do you make accurate decisions when variance in estimates from a single factor can change the return on investment by a factor of three?

It feels highfalutin to say, but the person who answers those questions needs to have "product vision." They need to be connected with customers, the dev team, and the support teams. And for TinyPilot, the only person in that position is me.

One possible solution is to hire a product manager whose job is to take high level strategy, turn that into a plan, and execute it with the team. That's not very practical, as it's an additional person to manage and loop into communications with the team. I'm currently managing six people, and that feels like my upper bound on how many people I can manage effectively.

Another possible solution would be to give an existing team member product manager responsibilities. I can't figure out a sensible path to that solution. It's not just another chore like bringing in the mail in the morning &mdash; they'd have to be looped in on almost all of the customer and team interactions that I see, so it's another 10-20 hours per week of work. And even if we did that, I'm not sure I could train someone to the point where they're making sound product decisions.

My plan now is to continue giving the dev team high-level strategy and a rough budget of dev hours for bugs and feature work. That's been working, but I'm still searching for ways to facilitate them making more decisions autonomously.

## Can I do a better job of delegating documentation?

Another area where I spend a lot of time is reviewing documentation.

And it's not so much that I spend so much wall time on it, but I use a lot of my "deep thinking" budget on reviewing documentation. I find that I'm capable of about one hour of writing per day. Sometimes, I'm more focused and can write for two or three hours, but I typically tap out after an hour and don't make useful progress.

I find that reviewing writing for other people is even more draining. Because not only am I thinking about how I'd express an idea, I have to think about why I'm choosing to express it that way and why I feel like that's stronger than what I'm reviewing.

I'm particular about documentation. If I see ways to improve it, I don't want to publish it until we've integrated the improvements.

It takes [years for writing skills to improve](/guides/hiring-content-writers/3-screening-candidates/).

Writing is mentally taxing. I have to be very focused. Giving constructive feedback on writing is even harder.

It's blocked on me, and not only that, it's blocked on my limited "writing mind" resources. I can think about writing or other hard tasks for about two hours per day.

I've considered pulling in a freelance technical writer, but that introduces more complexity into the writing pipeline, and it's another person to hire and manage. I also worry that it discourages people from improving the writing because the system would imply that you just write however you feel like, and then the technical writer fixes everything for you.

I have the same problem in code reviews, and I've [had to restrain myself](/human-code-reviews-2/#aim-to-bring-the-code-up-a-letter-grade-or-two). It's okay if the code isn't what I would do because users can't see it. But documentation, everyone can see it. There's a tangible difference between A-grade writing and B-grade writing.

I have a model in my head of what the typical TinyPilot customer is like, and I don't know how to articulate that model accurately to other people. And I think even when others understand the model, it's hard for them to write for that model.

This is complicated enough that it requires a screenshot or diagram to explain what's happening. You're assuming that our customers will recognize this term, but I think too many of them won't.

{{<img src="write-for-the-average.png" alt="Write for the average TinyPilot customer. The average TinyPilot customer understands these terms: Ethernet, WiFi, Local network, Keyboard / mouse input, USB / USB-C / USB 3.0, AC adapter, HDMI / VGA, Router / switch, Web browser, SSH. We assume that the average TinyPilot customer **does not** understand these terms / concepts: cached , PCB / HAT , audio breakout board , VPN , EDID , virtual display , NTP server. The best way to avoid confusing customers is to speak in terms they already understand. If thatâ€™s not possible, you can still use terms that customers might not recognize, but you should first define them." has-border="true" caption="Exceprt from TinyPilot's internal style guide about level of technical jargon to use" max-width="500px">}}

We have a team subscription to Grammarly, but it doesn't fit well with our workflows. People maybe use it on the first draft, but nobody wants to keep copy pasting an entire article into Grammarly after every edit.

I've looked at [Vale](https://vale.sh), which is developer-oriented, but it seems too primitive relative to Grammarly. But I just revisited it, and it looks like we could configure some low-noise rules, so it's worth investigating.

## Learing Nix vs. learning Zig

One of the results of shifting TinyPilot's manufacturing and fulfillment to third-party vendors is that I've had more time and mental bandwidth to learn new technologies. The two technologies I'd be eyeing from afar for the past two years are [Nix](/tags/nix/) and [Zig](/tags/zig/), and I finally got to experiment with both of them toward the end of 2023.

They're not at all competitors. The only similarity is that they're new open-source technologies, and they're both small underdogs trying to compete with larger entrenched competitors.

### I learn Zig by reasoning &mdash; I learn Nix through copy/paste

One of the complaints I've heard about Zig is that it has poor documentation. I've found the documentation to be pretty terse and written [more from the perspective of a compiler designer than a developer](/notes/zig-unit-test-c/#converting-a-zig-type-to-a-c-type), but I'm still able to scour discussions and experiment until I have an accurate mental model of how Zig works.

After six months of using Nix, I still have a terrible mental model of how Nix works. I've read multiple explanations of Nix, but the concepts haven't quite crystallized for me. When I create Nix files, I can only do it by copying an existing example and adjusting it to match what I want. Most of the file is just boilerplate, and I don't understand why it is the way it is.

When I hit an error in Zig, I can usually reason through it to do what I want. When I hit an error in Nix, I feel completely helpless.

I think one major difference is that I have a lot of development experience in C-style languages and no experience in pure functional languages. Zig is aimed at C and C++ developers, so the concepts make sense to me as someone who worked in those languages for ten years.

Nix seems very inspired by Haskell and other functional languages, which I've never learned. For a Haskell developer, Nix would probably feel more intuitive, and they might be confused by Zig's focus on pointers and memory allocators, which are not as prominent in functional languages.

### Developer experience on Zig feels narrow but deep, whereas Nix feels wide and shallow

Zig doesn't have tooling for [package management](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38837410) or code coverage. One of my disappointments with Zig so far has been that its support for microcrontrollers seems [mostly absent](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup).

{{<img src="zig-embedded-support.png" max-width="550px" has-border="true" caption="Zig has immature or non-existent support for all popular microcontrollers except the Raspberry Pi Pico.">}}

But when Zig claims it can do something, it does it well. I was skeptical of its claims that it can be a drop-in replacement for `gcc`, but every time I've swapped out `gcc` for `zig`, everything just works. Zig claims that you can just import a `.c` file into a Zig file, and [you can](/notes/zig-call-c-simple/).

My experience with Nix is that Nix attemps to do a much broader set of things, from simple things like [building a Node.js project](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Node.js) to grand things like [building and managing an entire OS](https://nixos.org/).

When my project perfectly matches what the Nix tooling expects, then everything works great. But I frequently run into situations where my setup is slightly different from what the Nix tooling expects, and I hit a brick wall. For example, I [still can't figure out](https://github.com/nix-community/pyproject.nix/issues/46#issuecomment-1869238745) how to run arbitrary Python projects under Nix.

One of the most surprising gaps in Nix is that [there's no official way to specify a package version](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/9682) you want to install. There have been eight years of discussion, and [there doesn't seem to be a solution](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/93327) or even an official acknowledgement that this will or won't be fixed.

### Nix leadership is decentralized, Zig has a BDFL

Andrew Kelly is the original creator of Zig. Several others have joined the project, but [Andrew is effectively still the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL)](https://kristoff.it/blog/interfacing-with-zig/). When I'd search for Zig documentation or help, I'd frequently encounter Andrew or someone official from the project giving an authoritative answer in a Github issue or forum discussion.

When I first heard about the project, I assumed [Eelco Dolstra](https://edolstra.github.io/) would be Nix's BDFL. He doesn't seem to be, at least not publicly.

Nix is Eelco's brainchild, as it came out of his [2006 PhD thesis](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf). Eelco is [president of the Nix Foundation](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/expanding-the-nixos-foundation/19929), but he also works for [Determinate Systems](https://determinate.systems/), a third-party consulting firm that promotes Nix. But they're decidedly third-party and not core to Nix. They release things that sometimes [clash](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-flakehub/32044/3?u=mtlynch) [controversially](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/parting-from-the-documentation-team/24900?u=mtlynch) with work from internal Nix teams.

While Zig feels centrally-planned, Nix feels rudderless. When I can't figure something out, my searches often bring me to the Nix Discourse forum or Github issues, and it's like people are discussing an alien technology that we've discovered by mistake. I never see someone from the Nix core team weigh in, and I don't even know if there is a core team.

### Older solutions usually don't work in Nix or Zig

Zig hasn't declared a stable 1.0 release yet, so it's typical for compiler updates to make breaking changes. Code that was valid in Zig 0.8.0 might not still be valid in Zig 0.11.0. In my experience, Zig tooling is pretty good at fixing the code automatically, but it's not 100% accurate.

In Nix, I've similarly run into problems with older examples. Nix is in the middle of a controversial revolution around flakes, a fairly new and still-not-official feature. But all the recent guides use flakes, and all the old discussions use not-flakes, so I have trouble applying pre-flakes solutions to my post-flakes environments.

### Zig requires full team buy-in, whereas Nix facilitates partial adoption

One nice property of Nix is that it's self-contained. I can drop a `flake.nix` into one of my projects to [automatically manage dependencies](/notes/nix-dev-environment/) without changing anything else or asking anything of my teammates.

Even if I'm the only Nix user on my team, the `flake.nix` still provides great value to me without costing anyone else anything or requiring them to use a new tool. It's like adding a `.vscode` directory to your project: helpful for people who use VS Code, doesn't really bother anyone else.

Zig, on the other hand, requires commitment and full-team buy-in. If you've got a C or C++ project, and you decide you want to switch to Zig, you can't just enjoy your better tooling and wait for your teammates to join you. As soon as you introduce Zig code into your project, everyone has to build it with the Zig compiler rather than a C/C++ compiler.

The only way to make Zig as portable as Nix is if Zig retrofitted every C and C++ compiler for Zig compatibility, but that's not realistic. But it means that I'm only exposed to Zig when I visit Zig-land by tinkering with code or looking at a Zig project, whereas I now bring Nix with me everywhere I go.
