{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $80-100k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

- We completed the first-ever TinyPilot release where I didn't perform any release task directly.
- Publishing a release through delegation helped identify many undocumented or poorly conceived steps in our release process.
- I'm continuing to enjoy writing a bytecode interpreter in Zig.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish TinyPilot Pro 2.6.3

- **Result**: We published the release.
- **Grade**: A

We were trying to expose any release steps that were accidentally silo'ed with me, so this was the first release where I didn't perform any release step directly. The team performed every step based on shared documentation, including things like writing [the changelist](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro/changes#263) and the [release announcement](https://tinypilotkvm.com/blog/whats-new-in-2024-03).

### Document TinyPilot Pro's release process internally

- **Result**: I documented enough to cover the release, but there are still areas to improve.
- **Grade**: B+

Documenting the release process was a great exercise. It exposed not only undocumented processes but also weaknesses in our process.

There were many parts to our release process that we hadn't examined critically. When I sat down to document them, I found that they were unnecessarily labor-intensive, error-prone, or pushed us to reinvent the wheel.

### File 2023 taxes

- **Result**: Gathered most documents, but I haven't filed yet.
- **Grade**: B

I ended up getting sidetracked by the TinyPilot release, so I haven't filed yet. Still, I think the government would appreciate me filing at some point this year, so I should probably do that.

We saw a big surge in visitors due to the attention [my annual review](/solo-developer-year-6/) generated, but it didn't seem to impact TinyPilot sales much. There was a 17% drop in sales, but that's mainly due to January being an atypically strong month. $75-95k/month in sales is our typical range.

I need a new way to report monthly profit because switching to the contract manufacturer has made our cash profit numbers basically meaningless at the one-month resolution. Our profit each month is dominated by the timing of manufacturing bills I pay every three to four months.

That said, our three-month trailing average profit is back in the $10-20k range I like to see.

## It turns out we have a 25-step release process

Originally, TinyPilot software releases were entirely my job. As the product matured and we added more steps to the process, releases grew to be 10-20 hours of work.

About 18 months in, I delegated the hardest release tasks to my teammates. That included most of the manual testing. That cut my time down to three to five hours per release, and I felt like I'd done a good job delegating.

For the last TinyPilot release, I challenged myself to delegate _everything_. I wanted to make sure releases could move forward at times when I'm not available.

I started writing instructions for the tasks I still owned, expecting to document just a handful of steps.

When I enumerated everything I was still doing every release, I realized we had 25 distinct subtasks as part of every release:

> ### Testing a release candidate
>
> 1. Create a release candidate build
> 1. Draft the changelog
> 1. Draft security advisories (if applicable)
> 1. Draft the release announcement
> 1. Update the test plan to cover any feature changes
> 1. Test release candidate on a Voyager device
> 1. Test updating from a released build to the release candidate
> 1. Test release candidate on a DIY device
> 1. Run automated end-to-end tests against a physical device
> 1. Review test results
> 1. Decide whether to publish the release
>
> ### Publishing the release
>
> 1. Publish security advisories (if applicable)
> 1. Publish the changelog
> 1. Publish TinyPilot Pro production release
> 1. Verify that updates to latest version work cleanly
> 1. Announce release to TinyPilot team
> 1. Add image hashes to changelog
> 1. Monitor bug reports for at least 48 hours
>
> ### Announcing the release
>
> 1. Publish TinyPilot Community release
> 1. Publish release announcement blog post
> 1. Share release with EU distributor
> 1. Share release with manufacturer
> 1. Update links in internal playbooks
> 1. Send release announcement to public mailing list
> 1. Share blog post on TinyPilotâ€™s Twitter

I had only documented and delegated three of them: the ones that required manual testing. But I was still doing the other 22 tasks.

Looking at the list, 25 steps just to do a release sounds like a lot. And really, it's far more than 25 steps because there are dozens of substeps within the testing steps.

When there are so many manual steps, it feels like the answer is to automate more, but I don't see any obvious candidates for automation. We could automate a step like adding the image hashes to our changelog or updating links in our internal playbooks, but it would probably take about 10 hours of automation work to save two manual hours per year.

The more important takeaway for me is to be conservative about adding tasks to our release and to challenge the necessity of what's currently there.

## How do we catch pre-release bugs?

Delegating release tasks turned out to be harder than normal delegation because I realized that even if I could explain how I made my decisions, my teammates were missing context to make those decisions.

As an example, I'll share a bug we encountered during final testing.

Usually, when you plug a device into your network, it accepts whatever local IP address the router assigns. Some users want their devices to request a static, predictable IP address. This last release, we added support in TinyPilot's web interface for adding a static IP address.

Here's what the feature looked like during our pre-release testing:

{{<video src="static-ip-test-2x.mp4" max-width="800px" caption="Recording of our pre-release testing for TinyPilot's new static IP feature">}}

The customer service team ran the test, and they reported no issues. The page loaded at the new IP address, as expected in the test plan. The support engineering team reviewed the video of the test, and they reported that the feature worked correctly.

I reviewed the video and saw a major problem. For a few moments before the web interface loaded at the new address, the user saw this scary error screen:

{{<img src="site-cannot-be-reached.webp" max-width="600px" has-border="true" caption="The dev team did not want the user to hit this error message, even briefly">}}

When I showed the dev team, they were heartbroken.

We had invested weeks of dev time into transitioning users from their dynamic IP to their static IP. This turned out to be particularly challenging due to complexity around DNS caching, local TLS certificates, and browser security protections for cross-domain requests. After a lot of testing and orchestration code, the dev team thought they finally had it right, but it turned out it didn't work smoothly in TinyPilot's office.

So, how do we catch bugs like that without me micromanaging the process? How do we avoid the disconnect between how different teams expect the feature to work?

We've decided to adjust the process so that when the dev team releases a new feature or changes old behavior, they review our pre-release testing footage to make sure it works how they expect.

## How do we decide which bugs to fix?

The next challenge in delegating the release process was figuring out what the release manager does with bugs they discover during pre-release testing. Do they postpone the release? Or do they ship the release with the bug as-is?

When the release was centralized on me, ship vs. fix decisions were easier, as I had context across teams. I'm looped in to the dev team, so I knew how long it would take to fix the bug and how much risk there was of breaking something else in the process. I'm also the product owner, so I understood how much the bug would impact customers. If it's an important enough feature relative to the costs of fixing the bug, I'd delay the release so we could fix the bug.

If the release manager is not me, how do they decide when to delay a release to fix a bug?

Our new strategy is that the release manager doesn't make the decision, but they gather all the information from the other teams to let the product owner decide. That way, we separate the process of gathering inputs to the decision from the decision itself. It serves our goal of minimizing the release tasks that only I can do.

## Side projects

### I've written the world's fastest (incomplete) Ethereum implementation

I [mentioned last month](retrospectives/2024/02/#side-projects) that I'd found a fun way to learn more about Zig, interpreters, and Ethereum &mdash; I'm writing an Ethereum bytecode interpreter in Zig.

Zig gives developers a high degree of control over performance, so one of my earliest tasks on my interpreter was to set up benchmarks in continuous integration to compare my implementation to the official Go implementation.

For a while, my Zig version was slightly underperforming the Go version. Then, I [refactored my benchmarking scripts](https://github.com/mtlynch/eth-zvm/pull/24), and my performance mysteriously tanked.

{{<img src="eth-benchmarks-before.webp" max-width="600px" has-border="true" caption="The official Go implementation was pummeling my Zig implementation (lower is better)">}}

I [asked for help on Ziggit](https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-build-run-is-10x-faster-than-compiled-binary/3446?u=mtlynch), a Zig forum, and it turned out I had a bug in both [my benchmarking scripts](https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-build-run-is-10x-faster-than-compiled-binary/3446/12?u=mtlynch) and [in my Zig code](https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-build-run-is-10x-faster-than-compiled-binary/3446/8?u=mtlynch). Once I fixed those two simple bugs, my Zig version zoomed past the Go version.

My Zig Ethereum implementation now outperforms the official Go implementation by 30-40%.

{{<img src="eth-benchmarks-after.webp" max-width="600px" has-border="true" caption="After fixing a few simple bugs, my Zig Ethereum implementation outperforms the official implementation by 30-40% (lower is better)">}}

To be fair, my version only implements about 3% of Ethereum, so I have an unfair advantage, but it continues to be a fun project.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Published [TinyPilot Pro 2.6.3](https://tinypilotkvm.com/blog/whats-new-in-2024-03).
- Identified undocumented steps in TinyPilot's release process and documented most of them.

### Lessons learned

- Delegating tasks becomes harder when the work requires cross-team collaboration.
  - Some decisions ultimately need to be made by the product owner, but teams can adjust processes so that gathering relevant information for the decision is a separate process from making the decision.

### Goals for next month

- Fill the gaps in TinyPilot's release documentation.
- Complete 2023 taxes.
