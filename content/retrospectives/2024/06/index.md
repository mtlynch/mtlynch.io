description: My takeaways from selling TinyPilot
---

## Overview

These were my takeaways. For the story of the sale, see, ["I Sold TinyPilot."](/i-sold-tinypilot/)

## What I'm glad I did

### Created a transition checklist

TinyPilot uses Notion for all internal documentation, so I kept the checklist in Notion. It defined the urgent things that had to happen the day of closing, things that should happen the week after closing, and the things that should happen a few weeks after that.

-
- Update banking information for these X accounts

I created this checklist before we even began due diligence, so I kept it in mind in the months leading up to it. Any time I did something, I'd think about how I'd need to hand it off to the new owner.

As I prepared for the transition, I'd realize something else needs to be updated quickly.

There were things that I wanted the buyer to do quickly like disconnect my credit cards from all the paid accounts. And then there were lower priority things that I thought should be on his radar, like how he probably wants to update everything in our playbooks that says, "If this happens, escalate to Michael."

### Worked with Quiet Light Brokerage

Chris Guthrie was great

Wish they used a better data room

I think they kind of oversold the packet, but I don't know what it would have been like without the packet

All fine, except I wish I objected to giving them a cut of inventory.

Glad that I pushed back on owing everything at closing because it meant that they feel the pain if they negotiate deals with deferred payment.

Idea was to front load all the due diligence into the packet.

Packet is more public than I realized. Anyone can just check a box and get it.

Wish they used some better tooling for data sharing. We just used Google Drive.

If I were to do it again, I would have waited to involve a broker until I couldn't find a strategic buyer. QLB was helpful in working with strategic buyers, especially since it was my first time, but probably not worth 7.5%. I didn't really get what brokers do. I would have been happy to work with a broker for the first time, but now that I've seen it from start to finish, I think a good broker would still add value, but not enough to be worth 7.5% of the company. The more critical part is the M&A lawyer to make sure you're covered legally.

### Don't do seller financing

When we pitched to the strategic buyer, they said, "Interest rates at banks are so high right now, so we'd prefer to do seller financing."

Banks have billions in resources dedicated to collecting loans. They have experience and special lawyers on staff and financial resources all ready. They have insights into a buyer's creditworthiness before the loan, and they have mechanisms to collect the debt after the sale.

I have none of that. So if a bank needs to charge 7% interest on a loan to compensate for their risk, the right risk-adjusted interest for me is probably 15-25%.

With seller financing, you work for the buyer.

### Assume I'll get nothing after closing

Treat the incentive awards as meaningless.

### Assume no control of the business post-close

But a buyer who says they're going to gut the business is more likely to gut the business than one who says they plan to keep things going.

### Avoid buyers who want a long transition period

One or two weeks of free work. After that, the buyer should be paying. If they push for a long transition period, it suggests they expect a lot of handholding and aren't capable of running a business themselves.

### Broker gets paid when I get paid

Negotiate that quiet light gets paid when I do.

### Discuss thorny issues without lawyers first

- Met with buyer to talk through contentious issues in the contract to understand what the underlying thing was they were trying to protect/prevent.

### Used dedicated accounts for the business

- Used a dedicated account for managing domain names so I didn't have to transfer each domain name one-by-one. I just handed over the entire hosting account.
- From the start, used a Twilio number for everything related to the business rather than my direct line, so I just handed over the Twilio account and the buyer changed to forward to his phone.
- Used Bitwarden for credentials

## What I'll do differently in the future

### Offer incentives for a cash buyer

Look for some opportunity to sell to a cash buyer even if it means selling at a 10% discount or so. Too much can change, and the buyer has way too much leverage by the end of the due diligence period.

A lot of the stress of the due diligence was feeling like I couldn't push back on requests for documents because I didn't know if it was coming from the bank or the buyer. If it was just the buyer, I'd have felt a lot more comfortable telling the buyer that I'm giving them the raw data in the format that my systems output it, and they can transform it however they want.

Banks hassled me a lot about addbacks, insisted on seeing invoices going back two years for certain categories of addback.

SBA adds lawyer work, so I probably lost $5-10k in legal fees.

### Shift contract negotiations to earlier in the process

The contract negotiations were the part I found most unpleasant about the whole deal, and I'm still not sure how to do it better.

The main issue was that I felt like I was in terrible negotiating position by the time we got to the APA. By the time we got to serious negotiations over the contract, it was already five weeks into due diligence, so I didn't want to risk starting the whole process over with a new buyer.

The ideal for me would be if the buyer had to present me with an APA before I sign an exclusive LOI with them, but the buyer isn't going to want to invest the time or money unless I'm exclusive with them.

What I'll try next time is to put a few terms I care about into the LOI. I'd want to include things like transition time and confidentiality, since I do a lot of public writing.

### Begin working with a lawyer earlier

I found a law firm when I started the process, and they reviewed the broker agreement, but I didn't reach out to them again until I had the APA. It turned out that they wanted to review the LOI as well. At the time, I felt like the LOI didn't matter because it wasn't binding anyway, so why bother reviewing.

In retrospect, I think it would have been helpful to include a few key things in the LOI. It's still not binding, but it sets a baseline before the APA.

### Create a separate, unofficial "small stuff" contract

Look for opportunities to cut things out of the contract that don't matter. There were parts of the contract where we burned $1k in lawyer time on things that had a value of $500.

If I do this again, one thing I'll propose to the buyer is that we create a separate agreement for stuff we want to do but it's too small to be worth codifying it into a real contract that lawyers have to review.

If we make a handshake agreement and the other person doesn't honor it, how much would it matter?

One example of this is selling the property in the TinyPilot office. The value of everything there was under $1,000 but we burned a lot of time working with the lawyers on how to transfer it. I wish I had just said that the property in the office was excluded from the sale, but the buyer and I make a handshake agreement that, in exchange for clearing the office, he can keep or sell anything there.

What's the worst the buyer could do to me? Not clear the office. So, I clear the office.

What's the worst I could do to the buyer? Not give him what I promised. But so what? He misses out on a $200 desktop PC and lots of obsolete TinyPilot parts?

### Don't catastrophize every setback

Every time the buyer's lawyer would put something in the contract that I felt was unfair, I would spin out. I felt like the buyer knew that I was desperate to have this process over with and they were taking advantage, and then I'd talk to the buyer, and they were super collaborative it would be fine. And then a week later, something else would happen, and I'd think, "Oh, boy. Now the buyer's _really_ trying to push me around!" And it would go the same way.

So one thing I hope I do in the future is learn to take things in stride more and sleep on it before I flip out.

### Reveal vendors earlier, but put tighter restrictions in LOI

Put stronger language in the contract that buyer can't contact suppliers if the deal doesn't close. Maybe wouldn't work if I was selling to a competitor. It was just too much of a pain to have to redact information from so many documents. And you only have to screw up once to make all the work worthless.

Forgetting to redact the vendor name in just one spot completely ruins hours of work. I spent hours manually placing black boxes on pages and pages of PDFs to hide vendor names, and then . And then the bank ended up insisting on seeing everything anyway.

### Eliminate inventory from the broker's commission

Negotiate harder about QLB's cut of inventory. I'd rather give them a higher cut of the sale price and 0% of inventory because I make nothing on inventory and it's just a consequence of what's around when the deal closes. Perverse incentives because I'm selling everything to the buyer at cost, but I essentially pay a 10% tax to QLB anyway, so I'm incentivized to keep inventory dangerously low. Also, made it awkward for my manufacturer because they want me to fulfill my PO, and I have to keep stalling but I don't want to explain why in case the deal falls through.

### Review contracts for non-transferability clauses

We use H.264, which means we need a patent license from MPEG-LA. If the buyer couldn't get the patent license. Not that they would have anything against the buyer just that they don't care. Their fees start at 100,000 units per year, and we're very far from that, so they have not much incentive to get the paperwork squared away in time for the sale.

But fortunately, they did, and it worked out.

### Assume from the start that nothing written is private

Everything goes to the new buyer, including emails and agenda. My wife was employee #1 and our of 200 email threads, there were two inappropriate jokes in emails.

- Review existing contracts that say what happens in a sale (look for terms like "transfer" or "notice").
- Be more transparent from the start of the company to the team that an acquisition is possible and defer the actual acquisition announcement until it's close to closing.
  - Jason Cohen talked about this in interview
- Define explicitly how to compensate for customers who buy before closing and request a refund after closing
- Define who pays for ads around closing time.
- Pending payouts and accounts receivable should default to seller.

### Think through the closing ahead of time

- Define explicitly how things work around the borders of the closing
  - Who receives revenue from sales on closing day?
  - Who pays employees for work on closing day?
  - Who receives pending payouts from orders before closing?
- Define who pays the fees.
  - Title company took $325 in fees out of my end, I asked for it back from buyer. Would have been good to just make that explicit upfront.

### Disconnect business bank accounts from business email before closing

Make sure buyer isn't controlling those bank accounts.

### Take even fewer dependencies on Google

Google Drive and GCP couldn't transfer to the buyer without creating a paid Google Workspace account.

## What surprised me

### The due diligence period is when you're weakest

Buyer has a lot of power because the deal takes 3 months to close. That's SUCH a long time.

Last time I bought a house, we asked for 10 days to do an inspection, and the buyer asked us to get it done in 7 days. And then the 5% deposit was due a few weeks later.

And that's a house! That's way less volatile than a business. With a business, a million things can happen that destroy the business. I remember my friend Cory Zue did an interview a few years ago where he said he had this irrational that his successful SaaS business would suddenly fail overnight. And then a month later, he lost 80% of his revenue due to COVID.

I didn't understand how much I was sacrificing when I signed the LOI for a three-month due diligence period. The buyer doesn't put down a deposit, so they can walk away at any time. But your business is inevitably weaker because the founder had to divert a huge amount of attention from their business to focus on the acquisition.

When we got to the point of reviewing contracts with lawyers, we were already two months in.

The negotiation itself keeps the business off the market for longer, which is bad for the seller.

At launch, TTM was $215k (2.8x multiple)
At LOI, TTM was $242k (2.5x multiple)
At close, TTM was $248k (2.4x multiple)

### Interest rates matter a lot

Interest rates matter a lot. I never paid attention to them before, but it makes a big deal when you're selling a company. If you're an investor with $500k to put someplace, the safest investment is Treasury bonds or FDIC-insured CDs. For most of the last decade, interest rates on Treasury bonds and CDs has been pitifully low, like under 1%.

So if you've got $500k to park someplace, 1% a year is not very attractive, so you'd look to more risky investments to get a better return. Buying a business at 4x earnings means that you're earning a 25% return on your investment every year. It's much riskier than a 0.1% CD, but the return is 250x higher, so it's probably a better bet.

In 2023, interest rates jumped to 5%. So would you rather take a guaranteed 5% return or a much more risky 25% return? It also means that taking out loans to buy a business is much less attractive because instead of paying 1% interest on your bank loan, you're now paying 7-9%.

### In the transition period, calendar duration matters more than hours

I agreed to 40 hours per week, but I realized pretty quickly after the sale that it was impossible for the buyer to take.

But I also had time off, so I agreed to extend the duration.

### Buyers have strong incentive to keep the seller happy

I worried that after the contract is over, maybe the buyer is going to start pushing me around because they already have all the assets. If they don't bother to update their billing information, and I get hit with a $2k charge, what leverage do I have to make the buyer pay me back?

It turns out that the leverage is institutional knowledge. If the buyer screws over the seller, it's bad for everyone. You can't codify every little thing in the contract.

The seller can be helpful or not helpful.

### Due diligence is unbounded work

I didn't feel like I could negotiate with the bank. The buyer isn't saying, "This is something I want." And I can't very well say, "Is this something you want or that the bank wants? Because if it's you, I'm going to say no."

### Due diligence bound me to a single seller, even beyond the due diligence period

The last time I bought a house, I offered a 10 day period for inspection. The seller pushed back and asked me to reduce it to seven days because if the deal fell through, even three days of keeping the house off-market could make a difference. And that's a house!

I didn't realize when I signed the LOI how much it costs me to take my business off the market for a full three months.

### Optimizing for SDE sucks

Wanted to redesign hardware to save costs but couldn't because it would make numbers look bad

Every time you spend money, it costs you 4x as much. For example, suppose the multiple for your business is about 3x. If your SDE is $100k, you can sell for $300k.

Now imagine you decided to give one of your employees a $10k bonus. Now your SDE is $90k, so your sale price is $270k. So to give the employee the $10k bonus, it costs you $40k.

### Lawyers insist on Microsoft Word but never learned to use it

Lawyers insist on using Microsoft Word but they're surprisingly bad at it. They manually number fields instead of using auto-numbering, they don't know how to cross-reference within a document, they insert dozens of line breaks instead of page breaks (which screws up layout when anything changes).

### If the non-compete is too restrictive, you're screwed

If the non-compete is too restrictive, you're screwed.

### If there's no cap on liability, you're screwed.

TODO

### Selling the business is all the boring parts of entrepreneurship

Have to continue selling at the same rate or better

But also spending 5-25% of your time on due diligence, legal agreements, logistics of the sale

You're constantly gathering documents and contracts and invoices and answering questions about decisions from years ago.
