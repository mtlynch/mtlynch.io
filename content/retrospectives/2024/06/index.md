description: My takeaways from selling TinyPilot
---

## Overview

In April this year, [I sold TinyPilot](/i-sold-tinypilot/), the bootstrapped business I founded and ran for four years.

My earlier post told the story of how the sale happened, but there are more details I want to share about the mechanics of the sale itself, what went well, what I want to improve in the future, and what surprised me.

## What I'm glad I did

### Invested heavily into documentation

Before I even started my first business, I read the book _Built to Sell_ by John Warrilow. The advice boils down to this: manage your company so that it doesn't depend on your day-to-day involvement. An effective company has a set of well-defined processes and teams that execute them.

I've always been a fan of clear documentation, so when I started building out the team for TinyPilot, I invested a lot into documentation. Rather than train people in person or on video calls, I would always write a playbook and ask the team member to follow it. If we ran into issues or misunderstandings, we'd update the playbook. When new people would join, they'd onboard via the same playbooks, and we'd continuously improve them.

After I sold TinyPilot, there was a 30-day period during which I would provide a maximum of 80 hours of consulting time to help the buyer with the transition. Most of my time post-transition was just introducing the new owner to the team and our key vendors. There was very little I had to answer outside of that because the buyer had access to all of our documentation, and the team already knew how to run the day-to-day of TinyPilot.

### Created a transition checklist

When I began serious discussions about selling TinyPilot, I started a checklist of all the things I wanted to do before I sold. It included things like deleting outdated information from our playbooks and ensuring that all of our account credentials were in the company Bitwarden account.

As we entered due diligence, I expanded this checklist to include things that would need to happen during the transition. I split the checklist into four categories:

- Things that should happen before closing
- Things that should happen a day or two after closing
- Things that should happen within the first week after closing
- Things that should happen within the first month after closing

It was helpful to start this checklist several months before the actual closing because I added to it as new things came to mind as we approached the final closing date. For example, I'd send a letter to one of TinyPilot's affiliate partners and then remember to add, "Introduce buyer to affiliates" to the post-close checklist.

The checklist turned out to be extremely valuable after the close. The week of closing is chaotic because so many workflows are changing, so it was helpful to have a checklist I created in calmer times.

### Worked with a broker I trusted

Worked with Microconf, heard positive things from another founder about them.

Spoke to Chris Guthrie at the event, and I felt good about the conversation.

Wish they used a better data room

I think they kind of oversold the packet, but I don't know what it would have been like without the packet

All fine, except I wish I objected to giving them a cut of inventory.

Glad that I pushed back on owing everything at closing because it meant that they feel the pain if they negotiate deals with deferred payment.

Idea was to front load all the due diligence into the packet.

Packet is more public than I realized. Anyone can just check a box and get it.

Wish they used some better tooling for data sharing. We just used Google Drive.

If I were to do it again, I would have waited to involve a broker until I couldn't find a strategic buyer. QLB was helpful in working with strategic buyers, especially since it was my first time, but probably not worth 7.5%. I didn't really get what brokers do. I would have been happy to work with a broker for the first time, but now that I've seen it from start to finish, I think a good broker would still add value, but not enough to be worth 7.5% of the company. The more critical part is the M&A lawyer to make sure you're covered legally.

### Avoided seller financing

When we pitched to the strategic buyer, they said, "Interest rates at banks are so high right now, so we'd prefer to do seller financing."

Banks have billions in resources dedicated to collecting loans. They have experience and special lawyers on staff and financial resources all ready. They have insights into a buyer's creditworthiness before the loan, and they have mechanisms to collect the debt after the sale.

I have none of that. So if a bank needs to charge 7% interest on a loan to compensate for their risk, the right risk-adjusted interest for me is probably 15-25%.

With seller financing, you work for the buyer.

### Assume I'll get nothing after closing

Treat the incentive awards as meaningless.

### Assume no control of the business post-close

But a buyer who says they're going to gut the business is more likely to gut the business than one who says they plan to keep things going.

### Avoid buyers who want a long transition period

One or two weeks of free work. After that, the buyer should be paying. If they push for a long transition period, it suggests they expect a lot of handholding and aren't capable of running a business themselves.

### Broker gets paid when I get paid

Negotiate that quiet light gets paid when I do.

### Discuss thorny issues without lawyers first

- Met with buyer to talk through contentious issues in the contract to understand what the underlying thing was they were trying to protect/prevent.

### Used dedicated accounts for the business

- Used a dedicated account for managing domain names so I didn't have to transfer each domain name one-by-one. I just handed over the entire hosting account.
- From the start, used a Twilio number for everything related to the business rather than my direct line, so I just handed over the Twilio account and the buyer changed to forward to his phone.
- Used Bitwarden for credentials

## What I'll do differently in the future

### Offer incentives for a cash buyer

Look for some opportunity to sell to a cash buyer even if it means selling at a 10% discount or so. Too much can change, and the buyer has way too much leverage by the end of the due diligence period.

A lot of the stress of the due diligence was feeling like I couldn't push back on requests for documents because I didn't know if it was coming from the bank or the buyer. If it was just the buyer, I'd have felt a lot more comfortable telling the buyer that I'm giving them the raw data in the format that my systems output it, and they can transform it however they want.

Banks hassled me a lot about addbacks, insisted on seeing invoices going back two years for certain categories of addback.

SBA adds lawyer work, so I probably lost $5-10k in legal fees.

### Shift contract negotiations to earlier in the process

The contract negotiations were the part I found most unpleasant about the whole deal, and I'm still not sure how to do it better.

The main issue was that I felt like I was in terrible negotiating position by the time we got to the APA. By the time we got to serious negotiations over the contract, it was already five weeks into due diligence, so I didn't want to risk starting the whole process over with a new buyer.

The ideal for me would be if the buyer had to present me with an APA before I sign an exclusive LOI with them, but the buyer isn't going to want to invest the time or money unless I'm exclusive with them.

What I'll try next time is to put a few terms I care about into the LOI. I'd want to include things like:

- Transition time
- Restrictions on confidentiality

### Begin working with a lawyer earlier

I found a law firm when I started the process, and they reviewed the broker agreement, but I didn't reach out to them again until I had the APA. It turned out that they wanted to review the LOI as well. At the time, I felt like the LOI didn't matter because it wasn't binding anyway, so why bother reviewing.

In retrospect, I think it would have been helpful to include a few key things in the LOI. It's still not binding, but it sets a baseline before the APA.

### Create an unofficial "small stuff" contract

Look for opportunities to cut things out of the contract that don't matter. There were parts of the contract where we burned $1k in lawyer time on things that had a value of $500.

If I do this again, one thing I'll propose to the buyer is that we create a separate agreement for stuff we want to do but it's too small to be worth codifying it into a real contract that lawyers have to review.

If we make a handshake agreement and the other person doesn't honor it, how much would it matter?

One example of this is selling the property in the TinyPilot office. The value of everything there was under $1,000 but we burned a lot of time working with the lawyers on how to transfer it. I wish I had just said that the property in the office was excluded from the sale, but the buyer and I make a handshake agreement that, in exchange for clearing the office, he can keep or sell anything there.

What's the worst the buyer could do to me? Not clear the office. So, I clear the office.

What's the worst I could do to the buyer? Not give him what I promised. But so what? He misses out on a $200 desktop PC and lots of obsolete TinyPilot parts?

### Announce the sale to the team later

Deciding when to tell your team about an acquisition is extremely difficult, and I haven't seen anyone come up with a good solution to this problem.

If you keep the sale a secret until the deal closes, you're effectively lying to your team. An acquisition is something that will have a major impact on their lives, and there are important decisions they might make where it would greatly benefit them to know about the sale.

On the other hand, if you're completely transparent about the sale to your team, you take on a huge amount of risk. Members of the team might threaten to leave and put the sale in jeopardy unless you offer them bonuses or promotions. Or they might worry about the sale or lose motivation and their job performance might tank.

In the case of TinyPilot, I had a good relationship with every member of the team, so I didn't think anyone would use the sale against me, but I also find that people to unexpected things when relationships end, so I did worry about that risk.

In the end, I decided to tell the team as soon as I signed the agreement with the broker, but I ended up regretting it slightly. Nothing catastrophic happened, but there were things about the team knowing that made work more difficult.

I had reasoned that I owed it to the team to tell them because I would want to know if I were in their position. The thing I didn't realize at the time was that we had very different levels of risk.

Be more transparent from the start of the company to the team that an acquisition is possible and defer the actual acquisition announcement until it's close to closing.

### Don't catastrophize every setback

Every time the buyer's lawyer would put something in the contract that I felt was unfair, I would spin out. I felt like the buyer knew that I was desperate to have this process over with and they were taking advantage, and then I'd talk to the buyer, and they were super collaborative it would be fine. And then a week later, something else would happen, and I'd think, "Oh, boy. Now the buyer's _really_ trying to push me around!" And it would go the same way.

So one thing I hope I do in the future is learn to take things in stride more and sleep on it before I flip out.

### Reveal vendors earlier, but put tighter restrictions in LOI

Put stronger language in the contract that buyer can't contact suppliers if the deal doesn't close. Maybe wouldn't work if I was selling to a competitor. It was just too much of a pain to have to redact information from so many documents. And you only have to screw up once to make all the work worthless.

Forgetting to redact the vendor name in just one spot completely ruins hours of work. I spent hours manually placing black boxes on pages and pages of PDFs to hide vendor names, and then . And then the bank ended up insisting on seeing everything anyway.

### Eliminate inventory from the broker's commission

Negotiate harder about QLB's cut of inventory. I'd rather give them a higher cut of the sale price and 0% of inventory because I make nothing on inventory and it's just a consequence of what's around when the deal closes. Perverse incentives because I'm selling everything to the buyer at cost, but I essentially pay a 10% tax to QLB anyway, so I'm incentivized to keep inventory dangerously low. Also, made it awkward for my manufacturer because they want me to fulfill my PO, and I have to keep stalling but I don't want to explain why in case the deal falls through.

### Review contracts for non-transferability clauses

We use H.264, which means we need a patent license from MPEG-LA. If the buyer couldn't get the patent license. Not that they would have anything against the buyer just that they don't care. Their fees start at 100,000 units per year, and we're very far from that, so they have not much incentive to get the paperwork squared away in time for the sale.

But fortunately, they did, and it worked out.

Review existing contracts that say what happens in a sale (look for terms like "transfer" or "notice").

### Assume from the start that nothing written is private

Everything goes to the new buyer, including emails and agenda. My wife was employee #1 and our of 200 email threads, there were two inappropriate jokes in emails.

### Define what happens to money flows around the time of closing

I didn't realize until late in the process that there's a lot of ambiguity around who's entitled to certain money that's flowing in and out of the business around the time of the closing. The buyer and I were able to find amicable resolutions to all these questions, but I wish I'd thought about them earlier:

- How do you split bills for services that straddle the closing (e.g., a monthly bill that's charged a week after closing)?
- What happens to funds in sales platform accounts that haven't yet transferred to the bank?
- Who pays when a customer purchases before closing but request a refund after closing?
- Who receives revenue from sales on closing day?
- Who pays employees for work on closing day?
- Who pays fees associated with closing (e.g., escrow fees)?

### Disconnect non-transferable accounts from business email before closing

Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. This is in contrast to a stock sale, where the buyer purchases the business and everything it owns.

Because this was an asset sale, I retained control of TinyPilot's bank accounts and payroll. The problem was that I forgot to change the email address on those accounts before I handed over control of TinyPilot's email account to the new buyer. For example, I didn't want the email address associated with my bank account to be bank@tinypilotkvm.com when I no longer could receive email at that address.

I worked with the new owner to fix up the email address on those accounts after the sale, and it wasn't a big deal, but I wish I'd done it myself while I still controlled the email account.

### Take even fewer dependencies on Google

Most account transitions were smooth. Everything was in Bitwarden, so I just added the new owner as an admin in our Bitwarden organization, and they were able to take possession of all the accounts.

The one account that couldn't transfer over was Google. I used Google Cloud Platform for some TinyPilot services, but I never created a dedicated TinyPilot GCP account. I just used a dedicated TinyPilot GCP project within my normal GCP account. I figured that when the time came, I'd just transfer the project to the new owner. There's a big "Migrate" button at the top of my GCP project settings, so I planned to just push that button and specify the new owner's GCP account as the destination.

{{<img src="gcp-migrate.webp" has-border="true">}}

When closing was complete and I finally clicked that button, I saw this error message:

{{<img src="gcp-error.png" has-border="true">}}

Google Drive and GCP couldn't transfer to the buyer without creating a paid Google Workspace account. The link points to a maze of Google documentation, and the jist seemed to be that both the new owner and I would need to create paid Google Workspace accounts and go through some complicated process from there.

We had a similar issue with some notes and old documents that I'd stored in Google Drive.

The new owner decided it was too much hassle and the value of the data in our Google accounts was too low that I exported what I could, and we deleted the rest.

In general, I've tried to minimize my dependencies on Google, both personally and professionally, as they frequently burn me with corner cases like these, so this is just a further reminder to depend on them even less.

## What surprised me

### Selling the business is all the boring parts of entrepreneurship

You're constantly gathering documents and contracts and invoices and answering questions about decisions from years ago.

### Optimizing for SDE sucks

Have to continue selling at the same rate or better

But also spending 5-25% of your time on due diligence, legal agreements, logistics of the sale

Wanted to redesign hardware to save costs but couldn't because it would make numbers look bad

Every time you spend money, it costs you 4x as much. For example, suppose the multiple for your business is about 3x. If your SDE is $100k, you can sell for $300k.

Now imagine you decided to give one of your employees a $10k bonus. Now your SDE is $90k, so your sale price is $270k. So to give the employee the $10k bonus, it costs you $40k.

### Due diligence is unbounded work

I didn't feel like I could negotiate with the bank. The buyer isn't saying, "This is something I want." And I can't very well say, "Is this something you want or that the bank wants? Because if it's you, I'm going to say no."

### Due diligence bound me to a single seller, even beyond the due diligence period

The last time I bought a house, I offered a 10 day period for inspection. The seller pushed back and asked me to reduce it to seven days because if the deal fell through, even three days of keeping the house off-market could make a difference. And that's a house!

I didn't realize when I signed the LOI how much it costs me to take my business off the market for a full three months.

### In the transition period, calendar duration matters more than hours

I agreed to 40 hours per week, but I realized pretty quickly after the sale that it was impossible for the buyer to take.

But I also had time off, so I agreed to extend the duration.

### Buyers have incentive to keep the seller happy

I worried that after the contract is over, maybe the buyer is going to start pushing me around because they already have all the assets. If they don't bother to update their billing information, and I get hit with a $2k charge, what leverage do I have to make the buyer pay me back?

It turns out that the leverage is institutional knowledge. If the buyer screws over the seller, it's bad for everyone. You can't codify every little thing in the contract.

The seller can be helpful or not helpful.

### Lawyers insist on Microsoft Word but never learned to use it

Lawyers insist on using Microsoft Word but they're surprisingly bad at it. They manually number fields instead of using auto-numbering, they don't know how to cross-reference within a document, they insert dozens of line breaks instead of page breaks (which screws up layout when anything changes).

### If the non-compete is too restrictive, you're screwed

If the non-compete is too restrictive, you're screwed.

### If there's no cap on liability, you're screwed.
