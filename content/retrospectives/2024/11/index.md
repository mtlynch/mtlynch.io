## Goal grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Enjoy family time

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Publish my tutorial on fuzz testing with Nix

- **Result**: I finally [finished the post](/nix-fuzz-testing-1/), but it didn't get much traction.
- **Grade**: A

I feel a bit conflicted about this post. Writing the post taught me a lot about Nix and fuzz testing, but I spent longer than I expected writing it. At first, I thought, "Oh, I can do a quick writeup in a few hours about what I did here," but I ended up spending 20+ hours on it.

I used to have a bad habit of feeling like once I learned something difficult, I absolutely had to write a blog post explaining it even if the audience for article was tiny or if I had no way of reaching readers. Previous examples include ["Hiring Content Writers: A Guide for Small Businesses"](/hiring-content-writers/) (there's an audience, but I don't have a good way of reaching them) and ["Retrofitting Apps for Cloud Storage with Zero Code Changes"](/retrofit-docker-gcs/) (too niche to be worth it).

I've spoken to readers who are glad that I've written those articles, but I also have to consider the opportunity cost. In the time I spent writing my Nix fuzzing article, was there another article that would benefit me more or reach more readers?

It's also discouraging to write software tutorials in an age of LLMs. Five years ago, there was a long-term return on tutorials, as people would discover them through web searches later. These days, if I write a niche tutorial, I think LLMs will just steal whatever I write, and the reader will have no idea it came from me.

## Easing back into work

## Implementing major features through stacked diffs

Not aware of any command that says to push the whole stack back up. And then you have to force push, which makes the Github PR ugly.
