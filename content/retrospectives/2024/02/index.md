**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $80-100k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## Abbreviated retro this month

This month, I'm only publishing an abbreviated retrospective.

I spent most of my writing time this month on my [sixth year retrospective](/solo-developer-year-6), and we're already close to March.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish annual retrospective

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Reach out to five bloggers about TinyPilot collaborations

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Get records ready for 2023 taxes

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

### Implementing a bytecode interpreter in Zig

I've been exploring Zig for the past few months, and one of the biggest obstacles to learning more is finding projects that are a good match for Zig.

Most of my ideas for projects are web apps. Go was designed for building web apps, whereas Zig was designed to be a more general-purpose replacement for C. But the result is that for 99% of web apps, Go is going to be a better tool than Zig.

Over the past few months, I've also been dipping into the books [_Crafting Interpreters_ by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and [_Mastering Ethereum_ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook). _Crafting Interpreters_ demonstrates how to implement a bytecode interpreter in C, and _Matering Ethereum_ describes how the core of Ethereum is a bytecode interpreter called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

So, I realized I could combine a few different interests by writing an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in Zig, so I started a project called [eth-zvm](https://github.com/mtlynch/eth-zvm).

I've only implemented about 2% of Ethereum, but my interpreter can already run real Ethereum programs and return the result.

Here is what it looks like when my interpreter runs a simple program compiled to Ethereum bytecode:

```bash
$ echo '600160005260206000f3' | xxd -r -p | zig-out/bin/eth-zvm -v
PUSH1 0x01
  Stack: push 0x1
---
PUSH1 0x00
  Stack: push 0x0
---
MSTORE
  Stack: pop 0x0
  Stack: pop 0x1
  Memory: Writing value=0x1 to memory offset=0
  Memory: 0x00000000000000000000000000000001
---
PUSH1 0x20
  Stack: push 0x20
---
PUSH1 0x00
  Stack: push 0x0
---
RETURN
  Stack: pop 0x0
  Stack: pop 0x20
  Memory: reading size=32 bytes from offset=0
  Return value: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
---
EVM gas used:    18
execution time:  792.395Âµs
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

You can compare my interpreter's results to the JavaScript implementation on the [evm.codes playground](https://www.evm.codes/playground).

I thought I would easily crush other interpreters in terms of performance because Zig itself is so performance-optimized, but it turns out that the official Go implementation of Ethereum is pretty fast:

{{<img src="eth-zvm-benchmarks.png" max-width="800px" has-border="true" caption="Benchmarks comparing my Ethereum virtual machine implementation to the official Go-based version (lower is better)">}}

My interpreter is still leaving a lot of performance optimizations on the table, so I bet I can beat the other implementations if I spend some time cutting out memory allocations.

I don't know how far I'll take the project, but it's serving as a practical way to build my knowledge of Zig, Ethereum, and interpreters. It's also a fun type of programming I haven't done in a long time because I have to be deliberate about every single byte I read or allocate from the OS.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Published ["My Sixth Year as a Bootstrapped Founder"](/solo-developer-year-6/), which reached [the #1 spot on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39398009) for the day.

### Lessons learned

-

### Goals for next month

- Publish TinyPilot Pro 2.6.3.
- Document TinyPilot Pro's release process internally.
- File 2023 taxes.
