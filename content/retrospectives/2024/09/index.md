## We had a baby

In August, my wife and I had a son.

We're trying to be protective of our son's privacy, so I took a photo of the three of us shortly after the birth and ran it through a hand-tuned fast Fourier transform to preserve privacy:

Why do people take such long parental leaves? Do babies really require 24/7 active attention from both parents?

So, they don't. Babies only need things for like a cumulative two hours per day. The problem is that those two hours come in unpredictable spurts throughout the day.

## Making the Framework 13 AMD 7040 my daily driver

## What should I do with my Hacker News course?

Before the baby arrived, I was racing to record everything. Now, the baby's here

First, the feedback from the course was that most students who took the live course mainly enrolled because they enjoyed my writing and didn't .

The material is all written, and I've recorded about 25% of the videos. But now that I have a baby, it's harder to find uninterrupted blocks to disappear to my office and record videos and it's also much more likely that baby noises will appear in the video. I had a tough time getting good takes when there were no interruptions or background noises at all.

So, for now, I'm going to pause the material and start working on _Refactoring English_.

For now, here's a teaser from the course. It's about why I think it's worth investing more effort in each article than most bloggers do.
