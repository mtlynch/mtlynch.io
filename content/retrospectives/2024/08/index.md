## Topic 2

## Is Merchant of Record a scam?

When I was running TinyPilot, I hated paying sales tax. I was only responsible for sales tax in two states: Massachusetts and North Carolina.

Paying sales tax in Massachusetts was straightforward and took about 20 minutes every quarter. I just added up all my sales to customers in Massachusetts and gave 6.25% to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.

Paying sales tax in North Carolina was [tedious and infuriating](https://x.com/deliberatecoder/status/1712875215091286350). It took me anywhere from three to eight hours to figure out how to pay North Carolina sales tax, and I had to repeat that exercise every quarter. Tax rates in North Carolina vary by county and some counties have multiple, separate taxes. You can't just add up all your sales in the state and take a percentage. You can't even sum your taxes by county. They make _you_ calculate for each county how much you owe in each type of tax.

Because of my experience with North Carolina, I decided I never wanted to sell in a way that forced me to pay per-state taxes again. So when I look for ways to accept payment for my course, I've been looking for services that offer Merchant of Record. That means that they pay the sales tax for you, and you just pay your income tax on profits.

Last week, LemonSqueezy, one of the few payment processors that supported Merchant of Record, announced that Stripe had acquired the company. In the Hacker News thread, [one comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41082681) caught my eye:

> I find the whole aspect of having MoR a fear mongering tactic to get you to pay extra transaction fees
>
> 99% of SaaS won't reach the MRR needed to justify MoR
>
> Of the 1% those breaking through 7 digit MRR can simply hire in house to manage tax remittance and not confuse their customers with invoices labelled with MoR's branding

I asked my accountant, and he confirmed that for most US states, the [minimum threshold](https://www.salestaxinstitute.com/resources/economic-nexus-state-guide) I have to hit to owe sales tax is around $100k or 100 transactions per year depending on the state. In populous states like California or New York, the minimum is $500k. If I reach the point where I'm exceeding enough states' minimums that it's a pain for me to pay sales tax, I can hire an accountant with the hundreds of thousands of dollars I'm earning from sales.

This is good news, as I'd been planning to sell on Gumroad, largely for their Merchant of Record feature. But Gumroad charges 10% and that doesn't even include payment processing fees.

Now that I know minimums for sales
