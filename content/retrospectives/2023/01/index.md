**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and in my professional life overall.

\* Profit is a naïve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

## Losing $250k in a single email

TinyPilot runs on top of the Raspberry Pi 4B, a small, inexpensive single-board computer. There's been a massive shortage of Raspberry Pis for the past year. It's been nearly impossible for consumers to buy them.

TinyPilot has lucked out in that we placed a year of orders in early 2021 directly from the manufacturer, The Raspberry Pi Foundation, and they've been consistently filling our orders every month.

As our sales have been been increasing, I've been nervous about whether Raspberry Pi would allocate more units to TinyPilot. In mid-December, I saw some good news about the Raspberry Pi supply. In fact, the blog post was literally titled ["it's good news!"](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-update-its-good-news/) The most important part was this sentence:

> As a result, we can say with confidence that, after a lean first quarter, we expect supply to recover to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2023, and to be unlimited in the second half of the year.

That sounded great! Even in mid-2020, I was able to buy 50+ Raspberry Pis at a time from local retailers, so if we were going back to that level, TinyPilot would be in wonderful position. But there was this ominous sentence later on:

> Although we are sitting on substantial order backlogs from commercial customers, we expect to gradually increase the fraction of our output which we dedicate to single-unit sales next year until we’re back in our pre-pandemic situation.

Uh oh. I'm a commercial customer. If they're deprioritizing commercial customers, that means less for TinyPilot. But still, I figured we'd be happy with a smaller slice of a larger pie.

I had emailed TinyPilot's sales rep at Raspberry Pi in mid-November asking to increase our allocation. She told me that they'd be deciding 2023 allocation in mid-December, so she'd let me know whether they'd take my new orders then. By December 20th, I still hadn't heard anything, so I followed up. The sales rep apologized for the delay but said the earliest they can offer a new order is August 28, 2023.

Actually, she said "28.08.2023." I re-read it several times desperately hoping for some interpretation of the date that made it less than eight months of waiting for a new order.

We still have standing orders through May 2023, but I was hoping to increase them. And we'll have to last three months with no new Pi shipments.

For the past three months, we'd been selling an average of 220 Voyager 2s per month. I expected to grow sales by about 35% over the next eight months, which would mean selling about 250 Voyager 2s per month. Given our current supply of Pis, we're limited to selling about 140 Voyager 2s per month. What would have been about $875k in revenue is now limited to about $425k. So when I got that email, I realized I'd just lost about $450k.

To be fair, it's silly to whine about how much money I could have made had I received more allocation from Raspberry Pi. A monkey could get rich buying Raspberry Pis at the $45 manufacturer price. There's a huge unmet demand for Raspberry Pis, so scalpers sell them on eBay and Amazon for $125 apiece.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Transitioned all remote contractors from TopTracker and Deel to Toggl and Pilot.
  - TopTracker is fine, but it's free and you get what you pay for.
  - Deel was a poor experience, and Pilot is not spectacular, but it's better.
- Mapped out and delegated tasks needed to release Voyager 2a in January.
