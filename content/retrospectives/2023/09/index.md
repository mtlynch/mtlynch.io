**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Shift manufacturing to our contract manufacturer as quickly as possible

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Create a detailed plan for moving out of TinyPilot's local office

- **Result**: We now have a month-by-month moveout plan with target dates and milestones.
- **Grade**: A

There's still a chicken-and-egg problem with some of the equipment I want to sell. Like if we sell the printer, how do we print shipping labels to sell anything else? But worse comes to worst, I just store the leftovers at my house and sell from here.

### Test an option for auto-renewing TinyPilot licenses

- **Result**: Tried to test but found no suitable tools
- **Grade**: B

Shopify has no native support for recurring subscriptions, so I had to search through the 50+ third-party Shopify apps that add this functionality. The problem is that almost all of them are designed for subscription box services where the customer wants to receive physical goods on a recurring basis.

Most of the Shopify subscription apps didn't support digital products. The few that did would only work on a native Shopify store, which I [don't have](/tinypilot-redesign/#why-didnt-you-just-use-a-shopify-template).

My options at this point are:

1. Sell renewing subscriptions outside of Shopify entirely (e.g., with Paddle, LemonSqueezy, Stripe).
1. Convert TinyPilot's purchase flow to a native Shopify store and then revisit Shopify's third-party subscription apps.

(1) requires the dev team to build a lot of infrastructure to support an off-Shopify checkout and to make sure our support teams still can access customer information outside of Shopify.

(2) keeps everything consolidated in Shopify, but it's also a major project. The last time I asked someone for an estimate, they quoted me $20k for the conversion. It's something I'd like to do eventually because a native Shopify store would have lots of other benefits, but I don't have bandwidth to take it on right now.
