**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## Highlights

-

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Onboard the newest TinyPilot employee

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Reach $90k in revenue

- **Result**: Reached $92k in revenue.
- **Grade**: A+

TODO

### Find three homelab bloggers or YouTubers interested in reviewing TinyPilot Voyager 2a

- **Result**: Found 2.5 people interested in reviewing TinyPilot.
- **Grade**: B+

Two are interested and plan to feature it in a video, and the third doesn't do reviews, but is open to giving TinyPilot a cameo if they can find a use for it.
