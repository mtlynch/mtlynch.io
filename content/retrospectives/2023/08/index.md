{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## How can TinyPilot increase recurring revenue?

When TinyPilot's sales slump, I start to think more about recurring revenue. In the bootstrapper community, most successful businesses have recurring revenue. TinyPilot is an oddity in that

I keep waiting for the day that everyone who wants a TinyPilot has one, and then what am I going to do?

## How TinyPilot Pro licenses work today

I first began work work on a premium version of TinyPilot's software a few weeks after I released the original DIY TinyPilot kits in 2020. I was a few days into working on a system for checking license keys when I remembered the famous DHH post about billing. (TODO: link) I was working on a licensing scheme for TinyPilot, and I realized that if TinyPilot licenses lasted for a year, I didn't really need to figure it out for a year.

But now it's three years later, and I still haven't figured out license enforcement for TinyPilot Pro.

We advertise to customers that TinyPilot devices come with 12 months of free updates, but our dirty secret is that once you have a TinyPilot Pro installation, you can keep updating forever. The device doesn't have any way of tracking whether it's associated with a valid license. There are users who purchased in August 2020 that got free upgrades for two years after their licenses expired.

The vast majority of users probably don't even realize that their license expired at all. They assume, understandably so, that if TinyPilot continues delivering updates to their device, their license is still valid.

The main way that customers currently discover an expired license is when they try to factory reset their device, usually after their TinyPilot's disk goes bad from filesystem corruption. To download a TinyPilot Pro image they can flash to their microSD disk, the customer needs to enter their order details. If they ordered more than a year prior, we tell them that their license expired.

From the customer's perspective, this is a terrible way to find out that their license expired. Their filesystem got corrupted, so now their work is interrupted as they have to physically remove the TinyPilot's microSD and reflash it, and now we're shaking them down for more money?

The "license is expired" notice tells the customer that they can contact support, and we'll give them a copy of the latest version of TinyPilot Pro they qualify for under their license. But that's not great for the customer because they have to wait up to one business day for a response from us, and it's not great for us because now that the customer is back on the "free updates forever" train because they have a valid TinyPilot Pro image.

## What's the ideal version of TinyPilot Pro's licenses?

When I think about TinyPilot Pro licenses, I often get stuck thinking about all the challenges of changing parts of the system. As an exercise, I'm going to just pretend we have no constraints on implementation time or integrating different systems together.

If I had a magic wand, what would the ideal customer experience be for managing paid TinyPilot Pro licenses so that customers are happy and TinyPilot makes enough money to sustain continued support and development.

### Purchase experience

When the customer checks out, there's a little checkbox that says, "Auto-renew my TinyPilot Pro license annually." It's off by default, but if the user checks it, they get $50 off their purchase.

At any time, the customer can manage their license from a web dashboard. They can cancel their subscription, purchase an auto-renewing subscription, or purchase a one-time 12-month license.

### Updates

When the user receives their device, they can use it normally without being prompted for a license key. They only get prompted to enter a license key after a year of usage.

### Renewing

When the user's license expires, they can continue using TinyPilot Pro software. If they

We send them a friendly email saying that their license is expiring. Depending on how they're set up, we either tell them that they're enrolled in auto-renew or that their access to updates will stop in two weeks.

If they choose not to renew, they can continue using all of TinyPilot Pro's features, but they won't be able to download updates, and they won't be eligible for private customer support.

## What would make recurring subscriptions worth the effort?

For license renewals to be worthwhile, they'd need to generate at least $30k/yr in additional profit. I estimate payment processing for licenses will cost about 3%, so each license renewal nets TinyPilot about $77.

To hit my target number of $30k/yr in additional profit from licenses, a minimum of 387 customers per year would have to renew their licenses each year.

Since we launched in 2020, TinyPilot has sold around 5,000 devices total. We sell around 2,700 new devices per year. Reaching 387 subscribers means convincing just 7.5% of our existing users to pay for continued updates, which seems doable.

## How can I test customers' willingness to renew their licenses?

### [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

I've been [experimenting with Nix](/tags/nix/) recently, and one of the features that interests me is `nix develop`. It lets you create a self-contained shell environment with exactly the dev tools you need to build and test your project.

One of the annoyances I run into with my various software projects is the difficulty of maintaining dependencies. My projects' dependencies are tied to specific versions like Go 1.19 or Node.js 16. Whenever I have to upgrade to the next version, it's a pain to figure out how to install it in my dev environment, then update the version numbers in my continuous integration (CI) configuration.

Worse, if I have multiple projects on the same system, updating Node.js for one project means that the other projects now have unexpected versions of Node.js and npm.

The promise of `nix develop` is that I could define the dependencies in one place: a [Nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes). If I needed to upgrade to the next version of Go, for example, I'd just update one file, re-run `nix develop`, and I'd have a local shell with the right version of Go, and my CI environment would run the same version. The environment is local to the directory, so changing package versions wouldn't affect any other projects on the same system.

I started experimenting with `nix develop` in [What Got Done](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/blob/dd3ea38885b04280bcea07f5294440e9a3521301/flake.nix) because it depends on particular versions of Go and Node.js.

It's been interesting playing with Nix for What Got Done's development environments, but here are the roadblocks I've run into so far:

- I [couldn't figure out how to make Go static binary builds work](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/15d874l/trying_to_create_a_nix_flake_for_go_with_static/), and [the solution](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/884/files) feels kind of like, "You should just know this magic incantation."
- There's no easy way to specify an exact version of a dependency.
  - I expected to be able to declare versions similar to Docker like `go:1.19.3`, but [Nix doesn't support this](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/9682).
  - For a tool that focuses so much on reproducibility, this really surprised me.
  - The closest solution I've found is to [use a third-party tool](https://gist.github.com/toraritte/62e53be9e6d88d8b6b97391eb3c6558b#22-pin-nixpkgs-in-a-nix-expression) to find the nixpkgs hash associated with a package version, then pin your package to that nixpkgs hash. Here's what that looks like for [one of What Got Done's dependencies](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/blob/67f098bace4c7d6302c193dc20e85d4e6a6761a2/flake.nix#L14-L18).
- Populating the Nix store is prohibitively slow.
  - There's a [`nixos/nix` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix) that I can spin up pretty quickly in CircleCI, but building the Nix environment for my Nix+Go flake takes about two minutes.
  - This means that any CI step I run has to burn two minutes just initializing Nix.
  - I tried caching the Nix store, but it's about 3 GB, which CircleCI takes about two minutes to download and decompress.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Published ["Installing NixOS on Raspberry Pi 4"](https://mtlynch.io/nixos-pi4/)
- Learned to use [hurl](https://hurl.dev/) to replace curl-based integration tests for HTTP APIs.
