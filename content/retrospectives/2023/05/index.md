**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

- We've completed transitioning TinyPilot's fulfillment to a third-party vendor.
- The local team is escaping their months-long stint in "urgent mode."

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Transition all products to our 3PL vendor

- **Result**: Our 3PL vendor is now shipping all of our products.
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Choose a contract manufacturer to take over TinyPilot's device assembly and begin the transition process

- **Result**: I'm still in discussions but haven't officially picked one.
- **Grade**: B-

I've found one contract manufacturer I like, but I still haven't officially signed with them. I'm waiting for an official price quote and timeline. It looks like the optimistic estimate for a first production batch is October 2023.

### Publish a new release of TinyPilot Pro

- **Result**: Published [TinyPilot Pro 2.5.4](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro/changes#254)
- **Grade**: A

This was not an exciting release feature wise, but it created a path for users to migrate off of Debian Buster, which is now a legacy OS version. Dropping support for Buster means eliminating a lot of complexity in our codebase where we had conditional logic for that OS version.

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

The numbers look scary because everything is down, but the difference is actually minor. Total revenue is only down 4%. Profit is probably down a scary-looking amount, but that's just a function of how lumpy expenses are. I'm still feeling positive about monthly profits in the $20-30k range.

## Getting over the 3PL hump

For the past few months, TinyPilot's local team has been working near 100% capacity, so my top priority was to find ways to reduce load on them.

One of the best bang-for-buck steps I saw in reducing the local team's workload was [completing our transition to a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor](/retrospectives/2023/04/#the-hiccups-in-transitioning-to-a-3pl-vendor). Since the beginning of TinyPilot, we've been shipping orders directly from our office. With a 3PL, we'd ship our products in bulk to a warehouse, and then the 3PL would handle the day-to-day work of fulfilling customer orders as they arrived.

Outsourcing fulfillment to a 3PL would definitely save us a good chunk of work, but it was a bit of a catch-22 in that the switch itself would take extra work.

Once we shipped our products to the 3PL, it would take about a week before the 3PL was ready to process orders. That meant that we had to build up an extra week's worth of inventory &mdash; no small feat when we were barely keeping up with the existing order volume.

I could have closed up shop for a week while we transitioned, but that would be akin to forfeiting $10-20k in lost sales. Instead, I took a few measures to reduce load for the local team so that they could focus their energy on building up our inventory.

First, I **decreased ad spending**. That was a no-brainer. There's no use spending money to attract new customers when we already have more demand than we can accomodate.

Second, I **increased prices**. I [bumped TinyPilot's price](#what-price-maximizes-profits) in several rounds to slow down the volume of sales while minimizing revenue loss.

Finally, I **pitched in on customer support**. The local staff covers assembly, fulfillment, and customer support. Every hour I could save the local staff on customer support meant another hour they could dedicate to building devices.

And fortunately, those efforts succeeded. At the beginning of May, the local team had built up enough of an inventory surplus to ship a week's worth of inventory to the 3PL. Once the 3PL was up and running, the local team's workload dropped by about 15% because the 3PL had taken over one of their main responsibilities.

The transition to the 3PL went pretty smoothly, but there are definitely things I'd plan better if I were doing it again. I've collected a set of [questions to ask a 3PL vendor](/notes/3pl-questions/) for others who are approaching 3PLs for the first time (or me, if I ever switch vendors in the future).

## Getting out of &ldquo;urgent mode&rdquo;

Even after outsourcing fulfillment to the 3PL, we couldn't relax as much as I'd hoped. With only a few days of inventory at the warehouse, the team was still scrambling to build new devices and replenish the 3PL vendor's stock.

I thought back to a year ago and wistfully remembered how much spare capacity the local team had. At that point, my biggest problem was [missing opportunities](/retrospectives/2022/02/#how-can-i-spend-less-time-coordinating-changes) to let them take on more responsibility.

This year, the situation had flipped. I was taking on tasks that the local team would otherwise be doing. And there was a constant feeling that we were struggling to stay on top of workload rather than just handling it calmly.

Worst of all, I couldn't get excited about strong sales. When I'd check Shopify and see we sold 10+ units in a single day, instead of celebrating the win, my first thought was, "Oh no! This is going to make it harder for us to build up inventory at the warehouse."

I felt like we'd be able to relax when we built up a month's worth of inventory at the 3PL warehouse. I did some quick spreadsheet calculations and estimated that it would take us until July to reach that point. I didn't want everyone to feel this way for another two months.

{{<img src="hypothetical-builds.webp" has-border="true" alt="Spreadsheet calculations showing inventory balance relative to our current sale and production rate" caption="By my estimates, it would take us until July to build up a healthy inventory at our 3PL.">}}

I'd considered hiring a third local employee over the past few months, but I was reticent because I expected load to drop a bit once we moved fulfillment to a 3PL and then drop a lot once we moved production to a contract manufacturer. At that point, the support team's job would reduce to customer support, and I didn't expect there to be enough work for three people.

When I saw there was still a significant workload after our 3PL transition, I came back to the idea of a third employee. And then a lightbulb went off, and I realized my worry was silly, as I could advertise it as a temporary position.

I posted the job on craigslist and in local Facebook groups. Over the course of two weeks, I received 18 applications, interviewed five people, and made one offer, which was accepted. The new employee begins work this week.

And there's definitely a change in mood.

## What price maximizes profits?

For the past two months, I've been increasing TinyPilot's price to reduce sales volume. I intentionally priced TinyPilot high so that we'd reduce total sales and have more time to catch up on inventory.

Now that we've caught our breath and have additional capacity to build devices, I can price our products to maximize profit rather than to accomodate production speed as a bottleneck.

I had experimented with pricing last month, but now I have more data, so let's see what the numbers look like.

### Voyager 2a USB-C

| Price | Time Period       | Days | Sales per Day | Revenue per Day | Profit per Day |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| $379  | Feb. 13 - Mar. 6  | 22   | 5.0           | $1,895          | $1,220         |

### Voyager 2a PoE

| Price | Time Period       | Days | Sales per Day | Revenue per Day | Profit per Day |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| $478  | Feb. 13 - Mar. 6  | 22   | 1.3           | $630            | $426           |
| $498  | Mar. 7 - Mar. 12  | 6    | 2.5           | $1,245          | $858           |
| $528  | Mar. 13 - Mar. 19 | 7    | 1.3           | $679            | $480           |

| $638  | Apr. 11 - May 3   | 23   | 0.9           | $583            | $441           |

Customers of the higher-end PoE version seem indifferent to prices between $478 and $528. They bought at roughly the same rate at either price, though the sample size is somewhat low.

### Decision: Sell at $399 + $99

Price should be a U-shaped curve. If I sell at too low a price, I'll. There's some optimal price where I'm selling not too many and not too few.

For the base model, the sweet spot seems to be around $399.

The week I sold the base model for $399 and the PoE version for +$99, it was a bit of a magic week. It was the top rate in terms of both revenue and profit. The sample size was small, but even based on the surrounding prices, it seems like the peak of the price-profit curve is somewhere around that $399 base price.
