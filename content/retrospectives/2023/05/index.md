**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

## Getting over the 3PL hump

My top priority right now is to transition TinyPilot's fulfillment to a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor. The 3PL's job is to keep finished products in a warehouse and then, pick, pack, and ship products when orders arrive.

It takes about a week to move products from our products to the 3PL vendor's warehouse into their systems. That means the first batch we send has to cover at least a week's worth of sales.

The problem is that the Voyager 2a takes longer than our previous products to build. We were barely keeping up with existing demand, so doubling our output to get a week ahead would be near-impossible.

I could have closed up shop for a week while we transitioned, but that's essentially forfeiting $10-20k in lost sales.

Instead, I took a few measures to reduce sales volume and reduce load for the team responsible for fulfillment.

First, I **decreased ad spending**. That was a no-brainer. There's no use spending money to attract new customers when we already have more demand than we can accomodate.

Second, I **increased prices**. I did the price bumps in several rounds to see when sales would slow down, but they never really did. More on that [below](#how-elastic-is-the-demand-for-tinypilot).

Third, I **pitched in on customer support**. The local staff covers assembly, fulfillment, and customer support. Time they spent on customer support was limiting how many devices they could build, so I took on customer support tickets as they arrived. Usually, I wait for staff to escalate exceptional cases to me.
