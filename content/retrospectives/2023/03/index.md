**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

We're in a strange position of growing revenues despite me trying to constrain sales. The fulfillment team simply doesn't have enough hours to fulfill more orders on top of their other responsibilities. is near capacity, so I've shut down sales on Amazon and advertising, but sales are continuing to grow. It could just be that word of mouth always drives our sales up, or it could be that more customers are buying because of the additional features we added to the product in the last couple of months.

We're also on our seventh consecutive month of positive three-month average trailing. So even with us limiting our sales, we're still growing. I expect we could hit $90k in monthly revenue once we can shift fulfillment to a 3PL vendor, as that will eliminate fulfillment hours as one of our sales bottlenecks.

## "Are you the TinyPilot guy?"

On a Saturday afternoon last month, I received a knock on my door at home. I answered it in my pajamas to find a guy in his mid-forties. "Are you the TinyPilot guy?" he asked.

Uh oh. Who's showing up at my doorstep asking about TinyPilot?

Before answering, I tried to recall any recent interactions with customers that might have led them to show up to my house and beat me up. I didn't remember anything.

"Yes..." I said, cautiously. He explained that he was the handyman at TinyPilot's office building, and he didn't have my phone number but he was able to find my home address.

"A pipe burst at the office, and we can't get into your suite. Can you come down?"

That didn't sound good. I got in the car to follow him to the TinyPilot office, mentally calculating whether the company could survive if 100% of our inventory was soaked in water. Even if we got an insurance payout, we'd be dead in the water for months before we could replace some of the electronics.

When I arrived on our floor, I saw that the sprinklers had gone off in the conference room adjacent to TinyPilot. I unlocked the TinyPilot office and breathed a sigh of relief. No water had gotten into our suit at all.

I notified the team that we wouldn't be able to use the office since they had to get approval from the fire department. On Monday, I called the landlord, and he said we could resume our normal use of the office.

I thought that was the end of it, but a few days later, in my 1:1 meeting with Eric on the fulfillment team, he asked if we were moving offices. "No, why?" I asked. "Oh, the handyman said offhandedly that we might have to move."

Uh oh. I called the landlord to find out what was going on. My landlord told me nonchalantly that yes, we might have to move to a new office by Tuesday. And this was Friday. Because of water damage, they might have to tear down one of our walls and replace it. But not to worry, he had a spare office we could use, though it was 40% smaller than the office we currently had filled to about 80% capacity. I asked how long we'd be in the smaller office, and he didn't know.

For the next few days, the landlord was fairly blase about whether we'd have to completely relocate with a day's notice. But ultimately, the builders told him that the wall could stay up, so we wouldn't need to move.

Overall, we only lost the one day of work, but the uncertainty was stressful, especially given that I was about to be out of the country for two weeks.

It was also a strong motivation to migrate to our 3PL. I'd love to be out of the position of fulfillment grinding to a halt because something goes wrong at our office. A pipe could still burst at our 3PL, but then moving things around to get back up and running is someone else's problem.

## My longest TinyPilot vacation

In February, I took my longest vacation since starting TinyPilot. It was one week of being completely on vacation, as in not checking emails. And then another week of checking email infrequently due to travel.

I attended a wedding in Tubingen, Germany for a week. Since there are a lot of TinyPilot-related people in Europe, I stayed for another week for what I called "my TinyPilot tour of Europe." It consisted of:

- Two nights in Karlsruhe, Germany to visit punkt.de, TinyPilot's European distributor
- Two nights in Berlin, Germany to visit one of TinyPilot's developers
- Two nights in London, England to visit both of TinyPilot's support engineers

The trip went well, but it was certainly a test for how TinyPilot functions without me. My longest vacation from TinyPilot (as in not checking TinyPilot emails at all) has been three days, and this was five. And then another week of infrequent Internet access working on my laptop.

One of the support engineers had planned vacation during two days of my vacation, leaving only one person handling technical support. And he got sick during those two days, so

On the fulfillment team, we were in a precarious position, but things ended up being fine. We're still getting our bearings, but the office move,. It's a good reminder of how valuable it will be to switch to a 3PL vendor. If we can queue our 3PL vendor with six to eight weeks of inventory, we can continue fulfilling orders no matter what happens at our local office, and we'll ease a lot of pressure on our fulfillment team.

It was tricky because we still haven't quite gotten our bearings since the transition to our new product. Adding audio introduces major new functionality, so there's been added load on support as customers ask new questions about the product. We're also offering trade-ins, which puts extra load on the fulfillment team.

The move also complicated things. At the time I was preparing to leave, my landlord still didn't have an answer as to whether we'd have to move. And if we did have to move, that would be a big problem because the fulfillment staff might not be able to reconnect our routers, printers, and workstations in the new office, which would block them from fulfilling orders.

## How do I support proactive work without getting buried in reactive work?

A topic I keep coming back to the past few months is the balance between proactive and reactive work at TinyPilot. Ideally, I'd like to automate or outsource all of the routine tasks at TinyPilot. In practice, that's not possible, as certain jobs are difficult to outsource, and most of our workflows change as the company evolves.

Instead, what I aim for is a balance where everyone on the TinyPilot team is doing about 50% proactive work and 50% reactive work. The reactive tasks are things like answering support tickets or building devices, and the proactive tasks are investing in things that reduce our load, like improving documentation or finding managed services to take over our work.

Everyone on the team is interested in taking on proactive work, but the problem is that I frequently become the bottleneck. For example, at a recent meeting with the support engineering team, I asked whether we could create more feedback cycles in our support. Currently, we document how to solve common support problems, but we don't track how often each type of request comes up or how frequently a particular resolution fixes the issue. If we tracked problem frequency, it would help us prioritize changes to the product or improvements to public documentation. If we tracked which resolution usually fixes it, it would inform which troubleshooting steps we recommend first.

The support engineers had good ideas for tracking these. One idea was to create a "problem bank" that detailed common problems, their symptoms, and possible resolutions. As we encountered issues, we could track frequencies in the problem bank. The other idea was to create formal decision trees that we could use to troubleshoot issues, and we could update the decision trees over time based on frequencies in the problem bank.

My normal next steps in a situation like that would be to write out workflows around these two ideas. But I knew if it was on me, it could be months before I'd have a few hours to invest in thinking it through. Instead, I wrote a meta document explaining how I define TinyPilot workflows. I shared that with the support engineers and assigned each of them to flesh out workflows for the ideas they'd proposed.

This was better than me doing it myself, and it allowed the support engineers to take on proactive work, but as soon as they had drafts ready, it turns into reactive work for me, because I need to review their proposals. And this is particularly difficult reactive work because defining workflows is hard. And it's somewhat time-sensitive because I know if you put a lot of work into a proposal, but then you have to wait weeks to hear feedback, you kind of forget the mindset of it, and it really drags. So, I struggle to find time to give feedback.

Part of me felt like I should just get out of the way and let the support engineers design their own workflows and adjust them as needed. And I considered doing it, but the first draft I read called for overhauling workflows outside the scope of the new idea, and it specified things that I felt like wouldn't happen in practice, so we'd end up with documentation that says one thing, but we actually do another in practice. And the more documentation you have like that, the less seriously people take any of the documentation.

The counter-example is the dev team, which is easier for a few reasons. First, I have much more experience as a developer, so I defined most of our critical workflows early. And the dev team has been around for two years, whereas the support engineering team formed six months ago.

It might simply be a matter of time. The dev team can operate mostly without me, even when their work involves large projects. The dev team has existed for two years, whereas the support engineering team has only existed for six months, so I think a large part of it is just giving people time to learn to operate more independently. I think as they get more experience, we'll converge on similar practices and shared styles of developing new workflows.

### Requests for help

{{<notice type="info">}}

I'm trying a new idea for a few months where I'm announcing ways readers can help me. If you're a fan of this blog and you think you might be able to help with one of these.

I'd like to speak with someone who has experience manufacturing electronics. As I start the process of shifting assembly to China, I'm interested in what pitfalls to avoid.
