**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Get back to our normal level of ready-to-ship TinyPilot devices.

- **Result**: We still don't have as comfortable an inventory buffer as we'd like.
- **Grade**: C

We're still behind on inventory, as there were a number of surprises that affected the fulfillment team this month. I've bumped prices and turned off ads until we get back on our feet.

### Start the process of transitioning to a new 3PL vendor.

- **Result**: We've signed with a new 3PL vendor and are preparing our first shipment to them.
- **Grade**: A

I'm hopeful about this new 3PL. Once we hand over fulfillment to an external vendor, it should relieve pressure on the team and give us breathing room to invest in other areas that allow us to scale up faster.

### Begin cross-team collaboration between the developers and support engineers.

- **Result**: TinyPilot its first dev and support engineering crossover meeting.
- **Grade**: A

\* Profit is a naïve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

We're in a strange position of growing revenues despite me trying to constrain sales. The fulfillment team simply doesn't have enough hours to fulfill more orders on top of their other responsibilities. is near capacity, so I've shut down sales on Amazon and advertising, but sales are continuing to grow. It could just be that word of mouth always drives our sales up, or it could be that more customers are buying because of the additional features we added to the product in the last couple of months.

We're also on our seventh consecutive month of positive three-month average trailing. So even with us limiting our sales, we're still growing. I expect we could hit $90k in monthly revenue once we can shift fulfillment to a 3PL vendor, as that will eliminate fulfillment hours as one of our sales bottlenecks.

## "Are you the TinyPilot guy?"

On a Saturday afternoon last month, I received a knock on my door at home. I answered it in my pajamas to find a guy in his mid-forties. "Are you the TinyPilot guy?" he asked.

Uh oh. Who's showing up at my doorstep asking about TinyPilot?

Before answering, I tried to recall any recent interactions with customers that might have led them to show up to my house and beat me up. I didn't remember anything.

"Yes..." I said, cautiously. He explained that he was the handyman at TinyPilot's office building, and he didn't have my phone number but he was able to find my home address.

"A pipe burst at the office, and we can't get into your suite. Can you come down?"

That didn't sound good. I got in the car to follow him to the TinyPilot office, mentally calculating whether the company could survive if 100% of our inventory was soaked in water. Even if we got an insurance payout, we'd be dead in the water for months before we could replace some of the electronics.

When I arrived on our floor, I saw that the sprinklers had gone off in the conference room adjacent to TinyPilot. I unlocked the TinyPilot office and breathed a sigh of relief. No water had gotten into our suite at all.

{{<img src="office-damage.webp" max-width="450px" caption="A pipe exploded in the office adjacent to TinyPilot's destroying everything inside." alt="Photo of a room with ceiling, carpets, and furniture all removed">}}

I notified the team that we wouldn't be able to use the office since they had to get approval from the fire department. On Monday, I called the landlord, and he said we could resume our normal use of the office.

I thought that was the end of it, but a few days later, in my 1:1 meeting with Eric on the fulfillment team, he asked if we were moving offices. "No, why?" I asked. "Oh, the handyman said offhandedly that we might have to move."

Uh oh. I called the landlord to find out what was going on. He explained &mdash; very nonchalantly, mind you &mdash; that yes, we might have to move to a new office by Tuesday. And this was Friday.

Because of water damage, the builders might have to tear down one of our walls and replace it. But not to worry, he had a spare office we could use. The new office was 40% smaller than our current office, and our current office was at about 80% capacity. I asked how long we'd be in the smaller office, and he didn't know.

For the next few days, the landlord was fairly blase about whether we'd have to completely relocate on a couple days' notice. And that was tricky because I was about to go to Europe for two weeks, so I wouldn't be available to set up the IT infrastructure in a new office.

Ultimately, the builders told him that the wall could stay up, so we wouldn't need to move. We only lost the one day of work, but the uncertainty was stressful.

It was also a strong motivation to migrate to our 3PL. I'd love to be out of the position of fulfillment grinding to a halt because something goes wrong at our office. A pipe could still burst at our 3PL, but then moving things around to get back up and running would become someone else's problem.

## My longest TinyPilot vacation

In February, I took my longest vacation since starting TinyPilot, which was either one or two weeks depending on how you measure it.

The trip began with a wedding I attended in Tübingen, Germany. During this time, I didn't check work emails at all.

{{<img src="tubingen.webp" max-width="450px" caption="Attending a wedding at town hall in Tubingen, Germany" alt="Photo of me in a Germany town square">}}

Many of the people I work with for TinyPilot live in Europe, so I stayed for another week for what I called "my TinyPilot tour of Europe." It consisted of:

- Two nights in Karlsruhe, Germany to visit [punkt.de](https://kvm-ip.de), TinyPilot's European distributor
- Two nights in Berlin, Germany to visit one of TinyPilot's developers
- Two nights in London, England to visit both of TinyPilot's support engineers

The trip went well, but it was certainly a test for how TinyPilot functions without me. My longest vacation from TinyPilot (as in not checking TinyPilot emails at all) has been five days, and this was 11. And I was following it up with another week on the road with inconsistent Internet access.

One of the support engineers had planned vacation during two days of my vacation, leaving only one person handling technical support. And he got sick during those two days, so

On the fulfillment team, we were in a precarious position, but things ended up being fine. We're still getting our bearings, but the office move,. It's a good reminder of how valuable it will be to switch to a 3PL vendor. If we can queue our 3PL vendor with six to eight weeks of inventory, we can continue fulfilling orders no matter what happens at our local office, and we'll ease a lot of pressure on our fulfillment team.

It was tricky because we still haven't quite gotten our bearings since the transition to our new product. Adding audio introduces major new functionality, so there's been added load on support as customers ask new questions about the product. We're also offering trade-ins, which puts extra load on the fulfillment team.

The move also complicated things. At the time I was preparing to leave, my landlord still didn't have an answer as to whether we'd have to move. And if we did have to move, that would be a big problem because the fulfillment staff might not be able to reconnect our routers, printers, and workstations in the new office, which would block them from fulfilling orders.

## Proactive work from the team generates reactive work for the founder

Over the last few months, I've been thinking a lot about the balance between reactive work and proactive work at TinyPilot. Reactive work includes things like answering support tickets. A support request is time-sensitive but it's low-impact as it only affects the one user with the issue. A proactive task is fixing the product or writing better public documentation so that the user doesn't need to file a support ticket to solve their problem.

I didn't realize until recently that proactive work that TinyPilot employees do usually results in reactive work for me. For example, when a support engineer writes a new tutorial, that's useful proactive work. It will reduce our support burden because users can find that article instead of contacting us. Before we publish the article, I need to review it. So now I have a reactive, time-sensitive task because I want to review the work while it's still fresh in the author's mind.

But it's difficult to review and give thoughtful feedback about writing because if something feels wrong, I can't just fix it. I have to break down my thought process to articulate my feeling to the author so that they understand why I'm requesting the change.

In the past few months, I'm increasingly the bottleneck on proactive tasks.

I'm debating whether I should get out of the way and just, but I keep deciding against it. I think writing documentation and designing workflows is something I do well, and I'd like to ensure my team is doing it consistently before I take myself out of the critical path.

We went through a similar process with the dev team. In the beginning, I was reviewing every code change. After several months, we switched to peer reviews, so the dev team can review code changes without me.

I think this is the right path. As I give feedback on things like writing, the support engineers continue to learn the TinyPilot style of writing documentation.

I need to consider my own bandwidth when choosing tasks. I know certain tasks will result in work that's difficult for me to review, so I need to budget for that.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Took a two-week personal/work trip.
- Signed a contract with our new 3PL vendor.
- Shipped [TinyPilot Pro 2.5.3](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro/changes#253), which adds audio streaming.

### Lessons learned

- Consider founder bandwidth when assigning
  - Even if the initial work can happen without the founder, make sure you're scheduling the work for a time when the founder will

### Goals for next month

- Transition fulfillment of a low-volume product to our new 3PL.
- Present at NERD Summit 2023.
- Reduce load on fulfillment team so that they're below 80% on reactive tasks.

### Requests for help

{{<notice type="info">}}

I'm trying a new idea for a few months where I'm announcing ways readers can help me. If you're a fan of this blog and you think you might be able to help with one of these, [email me](/about/).

I'm interested in [scaling TinyPilot's manufacturing](/retrospectives/2022/10/#what-happens-in-the-tinypilot-office) and finding that there's a lot I don't know about shifting manufacturing and assembly to China.

If you know someone with experience manufacturing electronics at the scale of 500 to 5,000 units per month, I'd love to speak with them. I'm open to taking on a co-founder, hiring a consultant, or just having a casual chat with someone who wants to share their expertise.
