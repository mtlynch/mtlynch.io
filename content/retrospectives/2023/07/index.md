**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

## Highlights

-

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Start a manufacturing batch with a new contract manufacturer

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Publish TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: A

TODO

### Reach $95k in revenue

- **Result**: Reached $93k in revenue.
- **Grade**: C

TinyPilot's earnings were fairly flat. A new review [came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx724dhxGxc) but it got a tepid response, so we saw fewer sales than I hoped.
