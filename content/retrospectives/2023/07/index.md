description: Where is my time going? (2023 edition)

{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

- I'm trying to figure out where I'm spending unnecessary time on TinyPilot.
- I realized I've once again become addicted to email.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Start a manufacturing batch with a new contract manufacturer

- **Result**: The first manufacturing batch has started.
- **Grade**: A

I signed the purchase order with our contract manufacturer, so the wheels are now in motion for our first production batch. It's scary because it's going to be the biggest single change to the business we've ever done. If it goes well, it will be great. If it goes badly, it will be catastrophic. I'm hoping for the former.

### Publish TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0

- **Result**: Published TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0 on schedule.
- **Grade**: A

Our June release went smoothly but felt underwhelming. A lot of our dev effort the two releases has focused on making updates simpler and less error-prone. The changes have made big differences in how maintainable the software is, but that doesn't sound exciting in a release announcement.

### Reach $95k in revenue

- **Result**: Reached $93k in revenue.
- **Grade**: C

TinyPilot's earnings were fairly flat. A new review [came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx724dhxGxc) but it got a tepid response, so we saw fewer sales than I hoped.

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

This was a flat month across most metrics. One of my marketing pushes fell flat, but I'm still optimistic about others I have cooking.

TinyPilot's ad effectiveness decreased substantially. In May, we made $3.64 in revenue for every $1 in ad spend. In June, each dollar of ad spend only got us $2.62 in revenue. Considering that each $2.62 of revenue costs about $0.90 in materials, our ads are still profitable but the margins are slimmer.

I'll give it another month, but if we continue seeing numbers like this, I'll book some time with TinyPilot's marketing consultant to see if there are opportunities to improve.

## Where does my time go?

At a recent indie founder meetup, I mentioned that my biggest challenge was finding time for [tasks that are important but non-urgent](/book-reports/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/#habit-3-put-first-things-first).

The other meetup attendees were surprised to hear this. I've been running TinyPilot for three years, and the business sounds like it should be easy to manage: we make the same product every day, and we ship it out when customers order it. Why couldn't I just automate or delegate everything? What required my attention specifically?

Last year, I found it useful to [evaluate how I was spending my time](/retrospectives/2022/02/#how-can-i-manage-tinypilot-with-only-20-hours-per-week), so now is a good time to revisit this.

Here are the tasks that occupy most of my time as TinyPilot's founder.

### Task 1: Coordinating changes

When TinyPilot's team grew past two people, I realized that one of my main responsibilities was to coordinate changes.

We're always iterating on all aspects of the business. We're improving the software, improving the hardware, integrating new vendors, adding more team members, etc. Most changes within one area of the buisness have ripple effects that affect other parts of the business. As TinyPilot has grown in headcount and complexity, the ripple effects have become more frequent and significant.

For example, when I [hired a third employee](/retrospectives/2023/05/#getting-out-of-ldquourgent-moderdquo) at the local office in April, that was a new role within the company. I had to define what the new team member would do and how their work would integrate with the existing staff.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

One of the suggestions at the meetup was that I should just hire a manager. That's harder than it sounds.

TinyPilot has three teams composed of two to three people each: software development, support engineering, and customer service / local operations. The three teams have mostly disjoint responsibilities.

If I hired someone to manage just one team, that wouldn't save me much time. If I hired someone to manage all three teams, they'd need experience managing a software team, so they'd probably need a salary of $125k/yr or more. That means the cost to hire that person would be at least $200k/yr, which would consume all of TinyPilot's current profits.

The best solution I can think of is the same as last year: [juggle fewer projects, and look for more opportunities to delegate](/retrospectives/2022/02/#how-can-i-spend-less-time-coordinating-changes).

There are some tasks that I feel like I have to take on because I notice parts that I can't delegate. Often, these tasks have subtasks that I can delegate effectively, but I miss those opportunities because I see one part requires me and fail to consider the possibility of dividing the work.

The other solution is pushing more work to vendors instead of doing it in-house. This year, we stopped doing our own fulfillment and transitioned the work a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor. That's made it harder to handle edge cases, but it eliminated entire categories of work we were managing internally before.

### Task 2: Managing the relationship with our 3PL partner

I expected that the work of transitioning to a 3PL vendor would be heavily front-loaded. It would be hard to pick a vendor and then overhaul all of our normal processes, but then once they got going, it would be pretty much set it and forget it.

I'm finding that there's still a long tail of little workflows we still need to figure out with the 3PL vendor:

- How do we keep track of inventory as it travels from our office to the 3PL warehouse?
- How do we verify that the 3PL isn't losing inventory within their warehouse?
- How do we resolve issues when the 3PL ships the wrong items in an order?
- How do we handle customers who want same-day shipping?

These are solvable problems, but we continue to hit new issues, so I spend a lot of my time thinking about our 3PL.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

This is an area where I shoudl be delegating more to my team.

I've started asking TinyPilot's local staff to become more active in managing the 3PL relationship, and it's going well.

Previously, for something like the problem of preventing the 3PL from losing inventory, I'd define a process for auditing their inventory reports and reconciling the numbers with our sales records. Instead, I asked a member of the local staff to do that, and I gave high-level feedback on the process rather than defining everything myself.

### Task 3: Overseeing dev work

I spend a lot of time overseeing dev work because it's the part of TinyPilot I enjoy the most. I'm still a developer at heart even though I don't get to spend much time writing code.

There are certain tasks I can do efficiently because I have more context than the dev team. contributions because I'm in touch with customers. I can often cut cruft because I know very few customers depend on it or that it exists for scenarios that I no longer consider important.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

The obvious answer here is that I should do less dev work.

Limit my time

### Task 4: Overseeing support work

The support engineering team does things like write new tutorials and documentation.

I still skim

#### How can I reduce my time here?

One thing I _could_ do but I'm kind of afraid to do is stop reading support tickets until my team escalates them to me.

I think there's still value in me at least skimming support threads. It helps me understand what customers are experiencing, and I use that in setting priorities for software development.

## Getting out of email addiction

Over the last few years, I've oscillated between having a healthy relationship with email and having an unproductive addiction to email.

### How did I lose my good email habits?

Once I have healthy email habits, it's generally easy to keep them up. What typically knocks me out of my healthy habit is when something happens where I have a legitimate need to watch my email aggressively.

Recently, the vendor we use to manufacture TinyPilot's metal cases ran late, and we were running out of the cases we had in stock. If we run out of cases, it's a huge pain &mdash; it blocks a lot of work for the team responsible for assembling devices. When that team has nothing to do, I need to scramble to reassign them. And their new tasks have to be things that they can drop on the floor again in a few days when we (hopefully) get cases again.

In situations like a case shortage, I feel like there's a legitimate need to check email obsessively. Suppose the vendor in China emails me on a Friday evening asking for a decision. If I let the email sit until Monday morning, they won't see my response until Tuesday morning in China. That's a three-day delay, which possibly translates into three days when TinyPilot can't assemble any new devices.

The problem is that after the emergency situation is over, I retain the habit of checking my email constantly. And when I check my email and there's nothing for me to respond to, I still crave the dopamine hit, so I check social media, which is never productive. Now instead of taking a 30-second break to check email, I've taken a 10-30-minute break to check social media.

### Solution 1: Only check email during scheduled email time

Historically, the way I break out of a bad email habit is by mapping out my day explicitly.

Each morning, I split my workday [into 30-minute blocks](/eliminate-distractions/#schedule-time-for-email-texts-and-social-media) and decide how to spend each block. To avoid checking email compulsively, I schedule time for reading and responding to email instead of letting emails be a background hum throughout the day.

I need to force myself to get back in this habit. It's easy to keep up once I'm in the rhythm, but .

### Solution 2: Empower my teammates to use peer review more

As I write this, it's 10 AM, and I've resisted checking my email so far today. But I have the burning feeling that I'm blocking work. I had given feedback on several tasks last week

We use peer reviews, and it goes well, but I'm still doing a lot of review. The two things that I've found hard to delegate to peer review are writing customer-facing documentation and defining internal workflows.

## Side projects

### Building my first home server rack

My fiance has pointed out that my office gets dirty because I have wires everywhere that make it hard to clean. I thought, "What? No, this is a normal amount of wires." But then I started looking at them and realized it was kind of a lot of wires...

{{<gallery caption="My office, upon closer inspection, kind of had a lot of wires">}}
{{<img src="office-wires-1.webp" max-width="400px">}}
{{<img src="office-wires-2.webp" max-width="400px">}}
{{</gallery>}}

I realized I could build a server rack, and we'd both be happy. I'd enjoy a fun project of building the rack, and she'd appreciate the tidiness of having all the wires in a self-contained unit.

So, I built my first server rack. It was fun to build, and it does make everything a lot tidier. With everything stacked vertically, there are fewer wires on the floor, and the whole thing moves on wheels for easy cleaning.

I'm using a managed switch and VLANs for the first time. At first, I found VLANs too cumbersome and hard to debug, but now that I've got the basics, I enjoy them. I want to make VLANs for everything.

I'm working on a longer writeup about how I chose all the components and what mistakes I made.

### Learning Nix

Nix has been at the top of my list of interesting-looking technologies for the past year. I've paused my programming side projects to tinker a bit with Nix and NixOS.

I wrote up notes about my first experiences with Nix, and the post. My notes on Nix unexpectedly got a lot of attention on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1670241507486441473) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36387874). People in the Nix community have been reaching out to me and offering guidance.

The results have encouraged me to capture more of my notes from just trying things that I don't fully understand.

My main blog feed is for polished posts, but I've been investing more in a ["notes"](/notes/) subsection for things that aren't as polished but I just want to capture what I've learned while it's fresh in my head. That's why I

### Implementing an authentication library for Go

When I started making web apps in 2018, I was too aware of the risks of managing authentication, so I always outsourced authentication to third-party services. That worked fine, but it created two other problems. The first was that it limited my products' adoption. Others could only deploy my apps on their servers if they also used the same authentication service I used. The other was test complexity. When I wrote end-to-end tests, they were slow and brittle because they depended on a third-party authentication service.

For my most recent project, [ScreenJournal](https://thescreenjournal.com/), I surveyed [what authentication libraries were available](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#authentication-and-oauth). My requirements were:

1. It had to be open-source.
1. It had to use Go, my current language of choice for web apps.
1. It had to be a library I build into my app rather than a separate service that runs alongside my app.
1. It had to support SQLite as a datastore.

[goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) (formerly gomniauth) is popular, but it breaks requirement (3), as it only works with external third-party services.

The other popular Go authentication solution is [authboss](https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss). The documentation is pretty sparse, which I later discovered was [an intentional choice the author made](authboss-support.png) to limit support requests.

I spent an afternoon trying to implement a simple web app with authboss, but I [couldn't even get the basics working](https://github.com/mtlynch/authboss-minimal/pull/6/files). The more I learned about authboss, the less it seemed to match what I wanted from an authentication library.

Now, I'm trying to create my own reusable authentication library. I'm not trying to make it a popular open-source package, just something that saves me the trouble of copy/pasting a bunch of auth code across all of my hobby projects.

Developing a resuable authentication library is an interesting challenge because it forces me to use Go features I don't normally use. It also stretches my architecture skills because I have to weigh tradeoffs between the library simplifying things vs. being more flexible to different forms of authentication.
