{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

- I'm trying to figure out where I'm spending unnecessary time on TinyPilot.
- I realized I've once again become addicted to email.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Start a manufacturing batch with a new contract manufacturer

- **Result**: The first manufacturing batch has started.
- **Grade**: A

I signed the purchase order with our contract manufacturer, so the wheels are now in motion for our first production batch. It's scary because it's going to be the biggest single change to the business we've ever done. If it goes well, it will be great. If it goes badly, it will be catastrophic. I'm hoping for the former.

### Publish TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0

- **Result**: Published TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0 on schedule.
- **Grade**: A

Our June release went smoothly but felt underwhelming. A lot of our dev effort the two releases has focused on making updates simpler and less error-prone. The changes have made big differences in how maintainable the software is, but that doesn't sound exciting in a release announcement.

### Reach $95k in revenue

- **Result**: Reached $93k in revenue.
- **Grade**: C

TinyPilot's earnings were fairly flat. A new review [came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx724dhxGxc) but it got a tepid response, so we saw fewer sales than I hoped.

## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com/?ref=mtlynch.io) stats

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

This was a flat month across most metrics. One of my marketing pushes fell flat, but I'm still optimistic about others I have cooking.

TinyPilot's ad effectiveness decreased substantially. In May, we made $3.64 in revenue for every $1 in ad spend. In June, each dollar of ad spend only got us $2.62 in revenue. Considering that each $2.62 of revenue costs about $0.90 in materials, our ads are still profitable but the margins are slimmer.

I'll give the ads another month. If performance doesn't improve, I'll book some time with TinyPilot's marketing consultant to see what we can fix.

## Where does my time go?

At a recent indie founder meetup, I mentioned that my biggest challenge was finding time for [tasks that are important but non-urgent](/book-reports/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/#habit-3-put-first-things-first).

The other meetup attendees were surprised. I've been running TinyPilot for three years, and the business sounds like it should be easy to manage: we make the same product every day, and we ship it out when customers order it. Why couldn't I just automate or delegate everything? What required my attention specifically?

Last year, I found it useful to [evaluate how I was spending my time](/retrospectives/2022/02/#how-can-i-manage-tinypilot-with-only-20-hours-per-week), so now is a good time to revisit this.

Here are the tasks that occupy most of my time as TinyPilot's founder.

### Task 1: Coordinating changes

When TinyPilot's team grew past two people, I realized that one of my main responsibilities was to coordinate changes.

TinyPilot grows in multiple dimensions in parallel: we improve the software, we improve the hardware, we integrate new vendors, we addi more team members, etc. Changes to one area of the buisness typically have ripple effects that impact other parts. As TinyPilot has grown in headcount and complexity, the ripple effects have become more frequent and significant.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

One of the suggestions at the meetup was that I should just hire a manager. That's harder than it sounds.

TinyPilot has three teams composed of two to three people each: software development, support engineering, and customer service / local operations. The three teams have mostly disjoint responsibilities.

If I hired someone to manage just one team, that wouldn't save me much time. If I hired someone to manage all three teams, they'd need experience managing a software team, so they'd probably need a salary of $125k/yr or more. That means the cost to hire that person would be at least $200k/yr, which would consume all of TinyPilot's current profits.

The best solution I can think of is the same as last year: [juggle fewer projects, and look for more opportunities to delegate](/retrospectives/2022/02/#how-can-i-spend-less-time-coordinating-changes).

There are some tasks that I take on because I notice parts that I can't delegate. For example, if a task consists of subtasks A, B, and C, and part B involves signing a contract on behalf of TinyPilot, I think, "Oh, I'm the only one who can do that." But sometimes I can delegate out tasks A and C, but I forget to consider the possibility.

The other solution is pushing more work to vendors instead and reducing the set of things TinyPilot does in-house. This year, we stopped doing our own fulfillment and transitioned the work a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor. That's made it harder to handle edge cases, but it eliminated entire categories of work we were managing internally before.

### Task 2: Managing the relationship with our 3PL partner

I expected that the work of transitioning to a 3PL vendor would be heavily front-loaded. I knew it would be hard to pick a vendor and make the switch. I though that once they got going, it would be mostly smooth sailing with small adjustments.

I'm finding that there's still a long tail of little workflows we still need to figure out with the 3PL vendor:

- How do we keep track of inventory as it travels from our office to the 3PL warehouse?
- How do we verify that the 3PL isn't losing inventory within their warehouse?
- How do we resolve issues when the 3PL ships the wrong items in an order?
- How do we handle customers who want same-day shipping?

These are solvable problems, but we continue to hit new issues, so I spend a lot of time thinking about our 3PL.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

This is an area where I shoudl be delegating more to the rest of the team.

I've started asking TinyPilot's local staff to become more active in managing the 3PL relationship, and that's working.

Previously, for something like the problem of preventing the 3PL from losing inventory, I'd define a process for auditing their inventory reports and reconciling the numbers with our sales records. Instead, I asked a member of the local staff to do that, and I gave high-level feedback on the process rather than defining everything myself.

### Task 3: Overseeing dev work

I spend a lot of time overseeing dev work because it's the part of TinyPilot I enjoy the most. I'm still a developer at heart even though I don't get to spend much time writing code.

There are certain tasks I can do efficiently because I have more context than the dev team. contributions because I'm in touch with customers. I can often cut cruft because I know very few customers depend on it or that it exists for scenarios that I no longer consider important.

#### How I can reduce my time here?

The obvious answer here is that I should do less dev work.

Limit my time

### Task 4: Reviewing documentation

In addition to providing day-to-day customer support, the support engineering team also writes documentation and tutorials. I'm particular about public-facing documentation, so I spend a lot of time reviewing the team's writing and giving feedback about style, clarity, and level of technical ability to target.

This doesn't take a lot of wall clock time, but it requires a lot of my focus. I find it difficult to write clearly, so it's even harder for me to read someone else's writing and articulate what I think is missing or unclear. I often end up the bottleneck on these tasks because even if I have a free hour to review a new tutorial, I often don't have the mental focus to give useful feedback.

#### How can I reduce my time here?

The easiest change I can make here is to make more use of peer reviews. On the dev team, the software engineers review 90% of each other's code without me having to be involved. It's harder to coordinate a consistent style for written English than it is for a programming language, but I think we can get to 80% of the work happening in peer review.

The other change I should make is taking my own bandwidth into account when assigning documentation tasks. I previously would put three tutorials in a row in the support engineering team's task queue, but then I wouldn't have capacity to review everything at once. Until most of the review work is happening in peer review, I should space out documentation tasks more so I have time to review.

## Getting out of email addiction

Over the last few years, I've oscillated between having a healthy relationship with email and having an unproductive addiction to email.

### How did I lose my good email habits?

Once I have healthy email habits, it's generally easy to keep them up. What typically knocks me out of my healthy habit is when something happens where I have a legitimate need to watch my email aggressively.

Recently, the vendor that manufactures TinyPilot's metal cases ran late, and we ran out of cases. Running out of cases is a huge pain, as it prevents us from assembling new devices. Then, I need to scramble to reassign tasks, and their new tasks have to be things that they can drop on the floor again in a few days when we (hopefully) get cases again.

In situations like a case shortage, I feel like there's a legitimate need to check email obsessively. If the vendor in China emails me on a Friday evening, and I let the email sit until Monday morning, they won't see my response until Tuesday morning in China. That's a three-day delay, which translates into three more days that the local team can't build new devices.

The problem is that after the emergency situation is over, I retain the habit of checking my email constantly. And when I check my email and there's nothing for me to respond to, I still crave the dopamine hit, so I check social media. That's never productive. Instead of taking a 30-second break to check email, I've taken a 10-30-minute break to check social media.

### Solution 1: Only check email during scheduled email time

Historically, the way I break out of a bad email habit is by mapping out my day explicitly.

Each morning, I split my workday [into 30-minute blocks](/eliminate-distractions/#schedule-time-for-email-texts-and-social-media) and decide how to spend each block. To avoid checking email compulsively, I schedule time for reading and responding to email instead of letting emails be a background hum throughout the day.

I need to force myself to get back in this habit. It's easy to keep up once I'm in the rhythm but hard to get into that rhythm. In the past, I grind out the first few days and then it becomes easier and rewarding enough that I don't have to rely on willpower.

### Solution 2: Encourage retroactive feedback

As I write this, it's 10 AM, and I've resisted checking my email so far today. But I have the burning feeling that I'm blocking work.

I think the reason I feel that way is that it's common for my teammates to ask me for feedback on support tickets, which is something I've encouraged. I'm realizing that the downside is that it makes my inbox more time-sensitive than it needs to be. Instead of the ticket being blocked on when either of the two support engineers have time, it's now blocked on me and the specific support engineer who escalated to me. I then feel like I have to respond quickly to avoid making the customer wait for days.

One option we've never tried is retroactive escalation. Instead of pausing a support ticket to wait for my feedback, if the person is somewhat confident, they respond with what they think is best and then in parallel ask me for feedback.

### Solution 3: Empower my teammates to use peer review more

I mentioned peer reviews when discussing [documentation review](#how-can-i-reduce-my-time-here), but I should be looking for more opportunities for peer review across all types of work. It makes sure people develop skills alongside their teammates and it reduces tasks that are blocked on me specifically.

## Side projects

### Building my first home server rack

My fiance has pointed out that my office gets dirty because I have wires everywhere that make it hard to clean. I thought, "What? No, this is a normal amount of wires." But then I started looking at them and realized it was kind of a lot of wires...

{{<gallery caption="My office, upon closer inspection, kind of had a lot of wires">}}
{{<img src="office-wires-1.webp" max-width="400px" alt="Photo of lots of wires in my office">}}
{{<img src="office-wires-2.webp" max-width="400px" alt="Photo of lots of wires in my office">}}
{{</gallery>}}

I realized I could build a server rack, and we'd both be happy. I'd enjoy a fun project of building the rack, and she'd appreciate the tidiness of having all the wires in a self-contained unit.

So, I built my first server rack. It was fun to build, and it does make everything a lot tidier. With everything stacked vertically, there are fewer wires on the floor, and the whole thing moves on wheels for easy cleaning.

{{<img src="server-rack.webp" max-width="400px" alt="Photo of server rack with patch panel, TP-Link switch, Tripp-Lite surge protector, CyberPower UPS, and shelves">}}

I'm using a [managed switch and VLANs](/notes/debugging-vlans-tp-link/) for the first time. At first, I found VLANs too cumbersome and hard to debug. Now that I've got the basics, I enjoy them and want to make VLANs for everything.

I'm working on a longer writeup about how I chose all the components and what mistakes I made, so stay tuned.

### Learning Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) has been at the top of my list of interesting-looking technologies for the past year. I've paused my programming side projects to tinker a bit with Nix and NixOS.

I wrote up notes about my first experiences with Nix, and the post. My notes on Nix unexpectedly got a lot of attention on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1670241507486441473) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36387874). People in the Nix community have been reaching out to me and offering to help me with the parts where I got stuck.

The results have encouraged me to capture more of my notes from just trying things that I don't fully understand.

My main blog feed is for polished posts, but I've been investing more in a ["notes"](/notes/) subsection for things that aren't as polished but I just want to capture what I've learned while it's fresh in my head.

### Implementing an authentication library for Go

When I started making web apps in 2018, I didn't want to roll my own authentication, so I always used third-party services.

Third-party authentication services worked okay, but it limited my products' adoption. Other developers could only deploy my apps if they also used the same authentication service I used.

The other problem with third-party authentication is that it makes end-to-end tests slower, less reliable, and more complex.

For my most recent project, [ScreenJournal](https://thescreenjournal.com/), I re-evaluated the prospect of bundling authentication into my app rather than relying on a third-party service.

I began by surveying [what authentication libraries were available](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#authentication-and-oauth). My requirements were:

1. It had to be open-source.
1. It had to use Go, my current language of choice for web apps.
1. It had to be a library I build into my app rather than a separate service that runs alongside my app.
1. It had to support SQLite as a datastore.

[goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) (formerly gomniauth) seems to be the most popular authentication library, but it breaks requirement (3), as it depends on external third-party services.

The other popular Go authentication solution is [authboss](https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss). The documentation is pretty sparse, which I later discovered was [an intentional choice the author made](authboss-support.png) to limit support requests.

I spent an afternoon trying to implement a simple web app with authboss, but I [couldn't even get the basics working](https://github.com/mtlynch/authboss-minimal/pull/6/files). The more I learned about authboss, the less it seemed to match what I wanted from an authentication library. It seems to expect clients to use authboss not only for authentication but also for page rendering and URL path routing, which is more than I want an auth library to handle.

Now, I'm trying to create my own reusable authentication library. I'm not trying to make it a popular open-source package, just something that saves me the trouble of copy/pasting a bunch of auth code across all of my hobby projects.

Developing a resuable authentication library is an interesting challenge because it forces me to use Go features I don't normally use. It also stretches my architecture skills because I have to weigh tradeoffs between the library simplifying things vs. being more flexible to different forms of authentication.
