**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

## "Everyone just gives us their admin password"

My top priority right now is to transition TinyPilot's fulfillment to a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor. The 3PL's job is to keep finished products in a warehouse and then, pick, pack, and ship products when orders arrive.

It's turning out to be harder than I thought to integrate with 3PLs. Our eCommerce platform is Shopify, one of the most popular platforms in the US. I thought surely that every 3PL would have an easy

Shipstation seems like the more modern solution.

The person who does it has to have special privileges on both the Shipstation account and the Shopify account.
