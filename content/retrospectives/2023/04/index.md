{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.
{{</notice>}}

## Highlights

- I've started the process of transitioning TinyPilot's fulfillment to a third-party vendor.
- TinyPilot customers are less sensitive to price than I expected.
- I invested a lot of resources into a hardware trade-in for TinyPilot that I'm not sure paid off.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Transition fulfillment of a low-volume product to our new 3PL

- **Result**: Our 3PL vendor has been fulfilling Power Connector orders for three weeks.
- **Grade**: A

There were a rough edges to smooth out, but we successfully transitioned our first product.

### Present at [NERD Summit 2023](https://nerdsummit.org/)

- **Result**: Presented my talk.
- **Grade**: A

It was fun to be back at NERD Summit in person for the first time since 2019. There were a lot of cool talks and fun hallway conversations.

### Reduce load on fulfillment team so that reactive tasks occupy less than 80% of their time

- **Result**: This was mostly successful but hard to measure.
- **Grade**: B

In order to transition to the 3PL, we needed to free up the local team's workload enough that they could build an extra week's worth of devices for the 3PL. We took several measures to reduce their load, though they also worked more hours than usual.

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

Switching from a 3D-printed case to a metal case seems to have dramatically increased demand for TinyPilot. Even as I increase prices and reduce marketing to near-zero, sales volume keeps increasing.

My goal for the year was to [reach $100k in profit](/solo-developer-year-5/#earn-100k-in-profit), but I'm already 75% there. I'm on track to reach $100k in annual profit before the end of April.

## The hiccups in transitioning to a 3PL vendor

My top priority right now is to transition TinyPilot's fulfillment to a third-party logistics (3PL) vendor. The 3PL's job is to keep finished products in a warehouse and then, pick, pack, and ship products when orders arrive.

To start the process, we gave the 3PL our lowest-volume product, the [TinyPilot Power Connector](https://tinypilotkvm.com/product/tinypilot-power-connector). It's for users who build their own TinyPilot devices, and we don't advertise it on our website, so we only sell 20-30 per month.

The Power Connector offered an easy-paced, low-risk way to test processes with our 3PL end-to-end before transitioning all orders over to them. We ran into some kinks in the process, so I'm glad we started with this experiment.

### "Everyone just gives us their admin password"

The first challenge was synchronizing our system with the 3PL's. TinyPilot's uses Shopify, one of the most popular eCommerce platforms in the US. Our 3PL uses Shipstation to manage orders. Shipstation is fairly popular, and I've heard positive things about it, so I thought it would be trivial to integrate Shopify with Shipstation.

With [my previous 3PL](/retrospectives/2023/02/#hiccups-in-transitioning-to-a-3pl-vendor), I installed an app in Shopify and pasted in the 3PL's access key. It was easy.

When my new 3PL sent instructions for integrating Shipstation with my Shopify account, they suggested I either give them my root admin credentials for Shopify or create a new admin account for them.

That couldn't be right.

I looked through the documentation for Shipstation, and I couldn't figure out the right way to integrate. It seemed like Shipstation was designed assuming that the same person owns both the Shopify account and the Shipstation account.

Shipstation's design put us in a deadlock. I couldn't link to the 3PL's Shipstation account because I didn't have their Shipstation admin credentials. The 3PL couldn't do it because they didn't have my Shopify admin credentials.

I didn't want to give the 3PL full admin rights on TinyPilot's Shopify, and I certainly didn't want to hand over credentials to my own account.

Instead, I created my own Shipstation account and a dummy Shopify user account with limited permissions. Then, I repeatedly tried to link TinyPilot's Shopify account with my test Shipstation account using the dummy Shopify user account with different permissions.

Through trial and error, I figured out the smallest set of permissions needed to link a Shipstation account to Shopify. Once I figured it out, I created a limited account for the 3PL in TinyPilot's Shopify with exactly the permissions they need to link their Shipstation account.

If anyone discovers this post who's in the same boat with Shopify and Shipstation, the permissions needed to link Shipstation from Shopify are:

- Orders
  - Edit orders
- View products
- Customers
- Manage settings
- Manage and install apps and channels

{{<img src="shipstation-permissions.png" max-width="400px" has-border="true" caption="The minimal set of Shopify permissions a user must have to link to a Shipstation account" alt="Screenshot of Shopify permissions for user to integrate with Shipstation">}}

I was surprised the process of integrating Shopify with the 3PL's Shipstation account was so complicated. The 3PL told me that they have dozens of Shopify customers, so how had they solved this process in the past?

"Everyone just gives us their admin password," the 3PL manager told me. She explained that most of their customers aren't particularly tech-savvy, so they don't find it unusual to offer their admin password to the vendor managing their fulfillment.

### Should we pay $150 to ship this $50 order?

The next hitch in our transition came when we received an order from Australia. Shipping rates to Australia are one of the highest of any country that TinyPilot serves. Shipping a TinyPilot Power Connector within the US costs a few dollars, but shipping it to Australia costs $50.

The 3PL contacted me saying that it would cost them $150 to ship this order. It turns out that I've been paying discounted rates for DHL's international shipping because I'm using a Shopify-negotiated rate. The 3PL didn't have a discounted rate with DHL, so they would have had to pay $150 for the postage to Australia.

If the 3PL purchased the standard postage, I'd be eating the $100 delta. The order would leave me $50 poorer than if the customer hadn't ordered at all.

Losing money on a single order wouldn't be such a big deal, but it indicated a deeper problem. The shipping prices that TinyPilot customers were seeing when they checked out were based on Shopify's shipping rates. I needed customers to see the shipping rates for my 3PL instead.

Again, I asked the 3PL, "What do your other customers do?"

They said their other customers either offer free shipping or set flat pricing per country that's independent of the size of the order. Those were potential solutions, but they felt sloppy. We'd always be guessing, and there were sure to be situations where we were substantially undercharging or overcharging customers for shipping. TinyPilot's current setup let customers choose their courier based on the exact shipping cost, and I wanted to preserve that.

I saw from Shipstation's documentation that it could share shipping rates with Shopify, so I asked the 3PL to contact Shipstation to find out how to set that up. The 3PL manager called me and said I'd need to upgrade my Shopify account.

I looked at Shopify's feature page and confirmed that the "Third-party calculated shipping rates" was only available in Shopify's Advanced plan:

{{<img src="third-party-shipping-rates.webp" has-border="true" alt="Screenshot of Shopify plans showing that third-party shipping rates are only available on Shopify's Advanced plan" caption="Shopify will only fetch third-party shipping rates on their $399/mo Advanced plan.">}}

That would take TinyPilot from Shopify's $105/mo tier to a whopping $399/mo plan, making Shopify TinyPilot's most expensive cloud service.

I was still on the phone with the 3PL manager while I figured this all out, and I somewhat impulsively upgraded right then and there. I'd made too big a stink about the shipping rates, so I was too embarrassed to back out at that point. But I did deliberately sign up for the monthly rate so I could change my mind later.

In retrospect, I still think the Shopify Advanced plan is worth it to avoid the work of maintaining static shipping costs per-country. And I'll make some of my money back because the high-tier plan reduces credit card fees by 0.2%. Using TinyPilot's revenue from last year, the fee discounts would have translated to about $2k less in credit card processing fees, so I'm at least getting back some of the $4,800/year I'm spending on this ridiculous plan.

## How elastic is the demand for TinyPilot?

TinyPilot's current primary constraint is manufacturing capacity. We're still assembling devices in-house, but orders are coming in about as quickly as TinyPilot's staff can build devices.

If we're gong to transition all of our products to the 3PL, it's not enough to keep up with orders. We need to build up at least a week's worth of surplus so we can send a batch to the 3PL's warehouse.

To slow down sales, I tried increasing TinyPilot's pricing. As a side effect, the change gave me interesting data about how TinyPilot's price affects demand.

In economics, the "elasticity" of a product is how sensitive consumers are to its price. Uber rides are a good example of an elastic product. If rides are cheap, you'll pay for the convenience, but if prices go up 10x, you'll probably take public transportation instead.

So, how sensitive are TinyPilot customers to price?

| Time Period       | Price | Sales Volume  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Feb. 13 - Mar. 6  | $379  | 110 (5.0/day) |
| Mar. 7 - Mar. 12  | $399  | 34 (5.7/day)  |
| Mar. 13 - Mar. 30 | $429  | 65 (3.6/day)  |

{{<img src="elasticity-poe.png" has-border="true" alt="Graph of price elasticity for TinyPilot Voyager 2a (PoE)">}}

### Reflecions

My sample is too small to make any strong claims, but the data suggest that TinyPilot's customers are less sensitive to price than I expected. Demand for the PoE model seems especially inelastic, as customers bought at roughly the same rate even when I raised the price by $80 (17%).

The capitalist in me wants to keep raising prices to maximize profits. The enthusiast in me wants to keep it affordable for casual users.

I was recently re-reading my blog post about [creating the first TinyPilot prototype](/tinypilot/#commercial-solutions) and noticed this line:

> Next, I looked at commercial KVM over IP solutions. They provide similar functionality to Dell‚Äôs iDRAC, but they‚Äôre external devices that connect to a computer‚Äôs keyboard, video, and mouse ports (hence the name KVM). Sadly, they‚Äôre even more expensive, ranging in price from $500 to $1000 per unit.

Now I'm the expensive commercial KVM over IP solution!

Perhaps irrationally, I want a TinyPilot offering that would have appealed to the version of me from 2020 who just wants an easy way to manage a [home server](/tags/homelab/) without spending a fortune.

I think the higher price makes sense now while TinyPilot is constrained in both [supply](/retrospectives/2023/01/#losing-450k-in-a-single-email) and [production speed](#getting-over-the-3pl-hump), but I'm hoping I can eventually reduce prices again and make it up in volume.

## Were trade-ins a dumb idea?

Every time TinyPilot releases a new hardware version, I get requests from customers asking if they can trade in their old devices for the newest model. In the past, I've told them we don't have a process for trade-ins, but I offer a generous discount on the new version.

This year, TinyPilot's primary constraint is the [availibility of Raspberry Pis](/retrospectives/2023/01/#losing-450k-in-a-single-email). Because of that, I'm trying to maximize the amount we can earn from our scarce supply of Raspberry Pis.

Instead of offering customers a discount on new devices, I had the brilliant idea of offering trade-ins. I thought trade-ins would be easy: the customer would send ther device to us, we'd recycled as many parts as possible to convert it to a Voyager 2a, then send it back.

In reality, the process was more complicated and labor-intensive. A lot of customers rely on their TinyPilots for day-to-day work, so they didn't want to be without it while we upgraded it. In those cases, we sold them a Voyager 2a made from refurbished parts, then gave them a partial refund when we received their trade-in.

And then there were customers who had multiple TinyPilot devices and needed all of them online. So, we'd send them a refurbished device, they'd send back a legacy device, we'd convert that to the newest version, send it back to them, then they'd send their next device, then repeat until we'd replaced all their devices. Some customers had four devices we replaced this way.

All the trade-ins went smoothly, but they were a lot more work than I expected.

It's hard to weigh the tradeoffs of this decision because the upside is intangible &mdash; we're rewarding customers who stick with us and want to support the product. The downside of the trade-ins are very tangible, however. Trade-ins took, on average, 2-3x longer to process than normal sales, and we did them basically at-cost.

If TinyPilot makdes a profit of $300-400 on each standard sale and each trade-in prevented us from making \~2.5 sales, each trade-in cost us $600-700. We did 22 trade-ins in total, so the trade-in program cost around $13k.

If I had to do it over, I would have still offered the trade-ins, but with these adjustments:

- Offer trade-ins to customers who asked but don't advertise the offer broadly.
- Use a separate support queue for trade-in requests, and set expectations that there might be a wait of a few weeks before we start the process with each customer.

## Side projects

### Reimplementing a Zestful microservice in Go

Back in 2018, when I was launching Zestful, my ingredient parsing service, I wanted a low-friction way for them to try out the service. Other services required you to create an account or put in a credit card, but I wanted to offer a [no-friction demo](https://zestfuldata.com/demo) on the Zestful website:

{{<img src="zestful-demo.webp" alt="Screenshot of Zestful demo page" caption="Zestful offers a [no-friction demo](https://zestfuldata.com/demo) to allow potential customers to test the ingredient parsing functionality." has-border="true" max-width="600px">}}

I needed the demo to limit each user to 30 parses per day. After that, they'd have to sign up for a paid plan.

At the time, I loved AppEngine and hated the idea of maintaining my own database. To implement the demo service, I wrote a Python 2.7 AppEngine microservice that acted as a proxy for Zestful's production ingredient parsing server.

When a request came in, the proxy would look up the user's IP address in Google Cloud Datastore. If the IP had used up all its quota, the proxy would reject the request with an error telling the user to sign up for a paid plan. If the user had remaining quota, the proxy would pass the request through and then deduct one unit from the quota for the client IP address.

Since 2018, I've [fallen out of love with AppEngine and Google Cloud in general](/litestream/#data-persistence-for-people-who-hate-database-servers). When I received a notice from Google telling me that they'd be turning down services running on AppEngine for Python 2.7, I thought it would be a fun experiment to see how much faster I could implement the service today than five years ago.

Instead of using Python, I used Go, as I find Go web apps much easier to reason about. I started thinking about how to design the database using SQLite and Litestream until I realized that I could skip the persistent datastore entirely.

If I keep everyone's quota in memory, what's the downside? Whenever I deploy a new version or restart the server, everyone's quota will reset, granting them more requests against the demo server. Given how infrequently I planned to restart the server and how low the penalty was of handing out free requests, I opted for keeping everything simple and in memory.

I reimplemented the service in about six dev hours, which pleased me because I remembered spending about two weeks on the original Python version. But then I went back and checked the commit history of the original and realized I actually implemented it in only two days. So, probably around 5-10 dev hours.

So, I'm not _that_ much faster than I was five years ago, but I'm proud of being able to recognize a new opportunity to simplify by skipping the database. I'm also glad that I'm continuing to learn new technologies so that I have more solutions available to me than I did in the past.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

- Presented at [NERD Summit](https://nerdsummit.org/).
- Found a new accountant and did most of the legwork for 2022 tax prep.

### Lessons learned

-

### Goals for next month

- Transition all products to our 3PL.
- Choose a contract manufacturer to take over TinyPilot's device assembly and begin the transition process.
- Publish a new release of TinyPilot Pro.

### Requests for help

If you or someone you can convince to talk to me has worked with contract manufacturers on a hardware product, I'd love to talk about the experience. I'm especially interested in people who have worked on an electronics product at low volumes, like 2,000-5,000 units per year.
