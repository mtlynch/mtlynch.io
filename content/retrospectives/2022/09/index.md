\* Profit is just a naive estimate based on the delta of my cash holdings. I'll update this when I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

August was a record month in TinyPilot's revenue and profit. And again, it was another "boring" month in that nothing out of the ordinary happened, so it's looking promising that this level of sales is sustainable.

One factor that I think increased sales was lowering prices. I [reduced prices by 11%](/retrospectives/2022/08/#experimenting-more-with-tinypilot-pricing) at the end of August, and it looks like that increased sales by 34%.

## Comparing remote work platforms for hiring

### We Work Remotely

One thing I disliked about We Work Remotely is that you can't suspend a job posting. XX weeks in, I tried to suspend my listing, so I clicked "Remove ad." I was expecting a prompt that would give me options to restore it during the time period I paid for, but nope. The ad disappeared immediately. No confirmation prompt, no undo button: gone. I emailed support and they restored it for me within a few hours, but it's still a pain.

Instead, I decided to just limit the applications to the United States. I can hire outside the US, but hiring within the US means that payments are a little easier, and the candidates are more likely to write well in English. But candidates can simply ignore the requirement, so many of the applicants I got after requiring US location were still outside the US.

### RemoteOK

RemoteOK is a one-person project started by Pieter Levels. I've been a fan of Pieter's for a long time from interviews he's given, but I'd never tried any of his products.

RemoteOK was, sadly, a huge letdown.

I can't recall the last time I've used a product where I feel like it's working against me. The most egregious example is that it adds text to your job listing without notifying you, and you can't turn it off.

### The hiring ecosystem is adversarial

The problem is that there are perverse incentives all around.

Employers have no incentive to treat rejected candidates well, so they ignore most candidates or reject them with an opaque form letter. Candidates don't want to invest a lot of time into an application that has a 95% chance of disappearing into the void, so they put less effort into each application. The employers see that most of the applications they receive are from candidates that put in minimal effort, so they put more mechanisms in place to automatically filter applications, and the cycle continues.

Employers also have no incentive to take down a job listing that they've paid for. You pay a price per month, so if you find a

When I post job applications, I try to break the race-to-the-bottom cycle by including this note:

> Michael Lynch, TinyPilot's founder reads every application personally.

> If you take the time to write thoughtful answers in your application, I'll send you an individualized note back, even if I decide not to move forward with your application.

###

The platform I use for internaional payments changed out from under me, so I could no longer use their built-in contract.

### Improvements for next time

- Hire someone to help me do the initial screening
  - I'll also update my note to take out the part where I say I read everything personally.
- Convert the application to a waitlist once I reach some reasonable limit of candidates (e.g., 400 candidates)
- Remember just how time-consuming it is to hire a new person.
