description: TinyPilot's first $100k month

{{<notice type="info">}}

**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and in my professional life overall.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Prepare to transition TinyPilot's fulfillment to a 3PL vendor

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Continue onboarding new support engineers

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

TODO

### Reduce projects where I'm in the critical path

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

\* Profit is a na√Øve calculation based on my change in cash holdings over the month. I'll update it after I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

## Worry when there's no time to sharpen the saw

In _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_, Stephen Covey describes refining your processes as "sharpening the saw." (TODO: quote)

I've always agreed with that idea, but this past month made me realize something else that's useful about sharpening the saw activities: they're an early warning that you're drifting into the unsustainable.

I asked them to. I realized I should have noticed that . The problem is that it's not really sharpening the saw. It's not time-sensitive but it's not sharpening the saw.

When you don't have time for long-term tasks, then you're in really bad position because you can't delegate or automate.
