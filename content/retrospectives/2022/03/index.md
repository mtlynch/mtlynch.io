title: "TinyPilot: Month 20"

description: TODO - One-line summary

## Highlights

*

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Launch Voyager 2: PoE Edition

* **Result**: XX
* **Grade**: A

TODO

### Hire a TinyPilot support engineer

* **Result**: XX
* **Grade**: A

TODO

### Complete design work on TinyPilot website overhaul

* **Result**: Deferred this until March
* **Grade**: N/A

The design firm I'm working with had too few hours to complete the design in February. I've negotiated guaranteed hours with them in March and April, so I expect to complete this by the end of the month.

\* Profit is just a rough estimate based on the delta in my cash holdings until I complete real bookkeeping for the month.

My profit is atypically high this month, but it's more a consequence of timing. I owe money to several vendors but it's just not due yet, and my business credit card finally increased my line of credit by $20k, so I'm holding more cash.

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

Is It Keto continues to languish.

Oof, my first zero month.

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

{{<revenue-graph project="zestful">}}

| Metric            | January 2022 | February 2022 | Change                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Unique Visitors   | 564          | 535           | <font color="red">-29 (-5%)</font>           |
| Total Pageviews   | 1,514        | 1,275         | <font color="red">-239 (-16%)</font>         |
| RapidAPI Revenue  | $847.38      | $271.25       | <font color="red">-$576.13 (-68%)</font>     |
| **Total Revenue** | **$847.38**  | **$271.25**   | **<font color="red">-$576.13 (-68%)</font>** |

Zestful was having a nice run of near $1k monthly revenues, but it seems to be tailing off. I haven't been following it closely, but I'd guess that the spike was due to a few customers doing bulk processing around the same time.
