**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs six other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and in my professional life overall.

## Highlights

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

- Reach out to three 3PL vendors to talk about the process of transitioning our fulfillment.

### Ramp up new support engineers

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

I'm aiming for the first one to be able to answer 80% of questions unassisted and the second 50%.

### Start production on a second metal case prototype

- **Result**: XX
- **Grade**: XX

### Goal 3
