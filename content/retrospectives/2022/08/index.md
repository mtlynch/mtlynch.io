## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com/?ref=mtlynch.io) stats

{{<revenue-graph project="tinypilot">}}

| Metric                   | June 2022      | July 2022        | Change                                        |

| Total Pageviews          | 18,764         | 33,578           | <font color="green">+14,814 (+79%)</font>     |

| **Profit**               | **-$4,230.17** | **-$7,485.91**\* | **<font color="red">-$3,255.74 (77%)</font>** |

\* July profit is just a naive estimate based on change in cash holdings until I do real bookkeeping mid-month.

Every month, I feel like my one-time costs are coming to a close, and then a large new one-time cost pops up.

## My redesign regret blog post

## Less tweeting, more blogging

Last month, Josh Pitzalis asked me on Twitter about something I'd written about programmatic SEO for local content.

{{<tweet user="joshpitzalis" id="1543083914071519232">}}

I knew I _had_ done programmatic SEO to generate pages for my local comedy site, WanderJest, but I didn't remember ever writing about it.

I searched my blog and couldn't find anything I'd written about generating city-specific pages for WanderJest. But then Josh ended up finding the thing he'd remembered reading: a Twitter thread I'd completely forgotten that I wrote:

{{<tweet user="deliberatecoder" id="1411709346845650944">}}

Ever since that exchange, I've been thinking about how I can keep more of my writing on my blog rather than on other platforms. Twitter is especially bad because it's so ephemeral. I forget what I post there, and it's difficult to find things there.

When I started blogging, it was because I'd run into situations that took me a long time to figure out, so I wanted to save other people the trouble. My early blog posts are mainly tutorials.

Over time, I found that readers responded more to things that were a little less. For example, GreenPiThumb was about the story of how my friend and I made a plant watering robot and not a walkthrough of our code.
