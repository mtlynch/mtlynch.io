**New here?**

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a software developer and the founder of [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com), an independent computer hardware company. I started the company in 2020, and it now earns $60-80k/month in revenue and employs seven other people.

Every month, I publish a retrospective like this one to share how things are going with my business and my professional life overall.

I'm trying a new idea this month where I announce ways readers can help me. If you're a fan of this blog and can connect me with people that are a match for what I'm looking for, [email me](/about/).
