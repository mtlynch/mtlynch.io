blurb: |
  What Got Done is a weekly task journaling site that lets users record their accomplishments and share them with teammates.

  I worked on it for a few months to teach myself Vue.js, but I couldn't find anyone interested in paying for it. I [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone), and I now work on it occasionally as a hobby project.
