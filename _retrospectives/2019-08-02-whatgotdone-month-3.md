## One-Line Summary

Ending the What Got Done experiment.

## Highlights

* I'm shelving [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com), as customers did not seem interested in the idea.
* [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) is a great challenge to my tendency to sweat the small stuff.
* [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) continues growing in the background, with a 22% increase in revenue and a 35% rise in traffic.

## Goal Grades

### Conduct five calls with new customers

* **Result**: Conducted nine calls and meetings (five for What Got Done, three for Zestful, one for a project idea)
* **Grade**: A+

I got almost twice as many interviews as I thought I would and gained valuable insights from the discussions.

### Implement two commonly-requested Zestful features

* **Result**: Added USDA matching and handling for "either/or" ingredients
* **Grade**: B

I successfully added a feature to Zestful that allows it to match user-supplied ingredients to entries in the [USDA's Food Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html), but coverage isn't as high as I hoped (I set out for 80% and achieved 73%).

USDA matching took longer than I expected, so I only had time to implement a minor improvement, which is to handle ingredient strings with either/or options. Given an ingredient like "2 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth", Zestful will pick a single ingredient, whereas its previous behavior was to return a nonsensical mashup like "chicken stock low-sodium."

### Add two engagement-encouraging features to What Got Done

* **Result**: Added a reactions feature and a preview panel for update drafts
* **Grade**: B

What Got Done users can now add [reactions](https://imgur.com/sN626Tm) to posts (e.g., thumbs up, celebration), but it had no apparent effect on engagement. Only two or three users have tried the feature.

Like with Zestful, I was short on time and couldn't implement the other feature I wanted (reminder emails), so I added a small, easy feature: [live markdown render previews](https://imgur.com/jRuRpjJ).

## Inactive projects

### Is It Keto

Now that Is It Keto is on the back burner, I'm not going to dive as deeply into its metrics, but here's a summary of the most interesting ones:

| Metric                 | June 2019 | July 2019 | Change |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $184.25   | $225.47   | <font color="green">+$41.22 (+22%)</font> |
| Unique Visitors        | 14,419    | 19,526    | <font color="green">+5,107 (+35%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 39,405    | 53,467    | <font color="green">+14,062 (+36%)</font> |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | 6         | 6         | 0 |
| Ranking Keywords (Moz) | 862       | 1,442     | <font color="green">+580 (+67%)</font> |

It feels strange to keep ignoring Is It Keto, given that it's grown at least 30-50% in traffic and revenue every month this year.

## Why use What Got Done when we have Slack?

In July, I conducted five customer interviews for What Got Done:

* Three were interviews with ex-Google founders who I found through cold outreach.
* One was an inbound inquiry from someone who read [my blog post about the joy of Snippets](/status-updates-to-nobody/).
* One was a tech startup owner near my house.

Four other founders responded to my emails to politely decline a meeting.

With the exception of the person who reached out to me, the consistent feedback I heard was that everyone is currently solving this with Slack and standup meetings. Nobody raved about their solution, but everyone agreed it solved the problem adequately enough that it wasn't worth exploring alternatives.

One other path that seemed viable in June was organic growth. If more people began using the free version, maybe it would gain momentum and people would push for their employers to adopt it. Unfortunately growth tapered off this month:

Based on July, I'm going to shelve What Got Done as a business idea and keep it as a personal tool. My primary motivation in building it was to teach myself [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It wasn't my strongest business idea, but I thought it was worth exploring if I was going to build it anyway. The result is that it doesn't seem viable, so I'm going to focus on other ideas that I think have stronger potential.

## Zestful and resisting the urge to fix everything

This month, I realized that [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com), my unprofitable ingredient parsing service, is the perfect project to tempt my perfectionist tendencies. It's built on a machine learning system, so the whole thing has so many imperfect parts that it's a challenge to resist fixing lots of little things.

Unfortunately, I often succumb to this temptation. For example, this month I realized that Zestful was incorrectly parsing the ingredient "ground cinnamon." It considered "cinnamon" the product and "ground" to be a preparation step for the ingredient, but realistically, few people grind their own cinnamon sticks, so the product should just be "ground cinnamon." I dug into the error and realized that many of the examples in my training dataset marked "ground" as a preparation step so the model got confused.

It seemed like a quick fix, but I probably spent 45 minutes hunting down all the bad "ground cinnamon" examples. I finally finished, proud to have eliminated an error case, and I realized that only 0.3% of Zestful's requests include "ground cinnamon." And the previous behavior to just return "cinnamon" was probably fine because everyone assumes "cinnamon" means ground cinnamon anyway.

{% include image.html file="ground-cinnamon.jpg" alt="Screenshot of parsing ground cinnamon on Zestful"  max_width="796px" class="img-border" img_link="true" fig_caption="Boy, did it take way too long to make this work" %}

Fixing these things is satisfying in the moment because it's fun to make my parser more accurate. The problem is that it's so easy to go down the rabbit hole and wake up days later realizing that overall accuracy has barely changed. The parser will never be 100% accurate, and I could spend an eternity chasing ever decreasing gains in accuracy.

My goal going forward is to resist the urge to fix issues on Zestful unless a paying customer asks for it.

## Integrating AdSense into Is It Keto

In June, I experimented with an advertising partner on my nutrition site, [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org). I ended up hating the result and decided to shut it off after 11 days. The ads were [ugly and screwed up my page for mobile users](/retrospectives/2019/07/#a-brief-experiment-with-display-ads-on-is-it-keto).

Still, it got me thinking about the appeal of banner ads to monetize Is It Keto. Prior to that experiment, Is It Keto only made money when people clicked on the site's Amazon product links. This was good for pages like [Metamucil](http://isitketo.org/metamucil) because a visitor might reasonably decide to buy [Metamucil fiber capsules](https://amzn.to/2ZqGbW1). It's not a good strategy for pages like [Lettuce](http://isitketo.org/lettuce) because nobody orders lettuce from Amazon (except for [some people who do](/keep-growing-never-profit/#i-didnt-think-through-my-monetization-strategy)).

Relying on Amazon Affiliate ads meant that most Is It Keto pages earned nothing unless they convinced the visitor to click through to another article about a more lucrative product. With banner ads, every popular page earned money for the site regardless of whether it encouraged the user to buy anything on Amazon.

So, I signed up for Google AdSense and have had a great experience so far. The key differences are:

* I control placement of the ads, unlike the previous ad partner who automatically crammed ads into any open space they could find.
* I can review ads to ensure that my users never see ads that are spammy or masquerade as features of my site (e.g., ads that [insert a fake "Print" button](/images/retrospectives/2019/07/isitketo-ads.png)).

So far, I'm earning $2.29 per 1,000 pageviews. My previous ad network measured in terms of unique visitors, so in those terms, I'm earning about ~$5 per 1,000 sessions. It's slightly less than the ~$8 I earned from the previous ad partner, but I'm happy with the current tradeoff of ad intrusiveness vs. revenue generation.

  * I arranged 3 meetings (20% conversion rate)

### Goals for May

* Publish a new blog post on mtlynch.io.
* Publish an MVP for my [email copywriter tool idea](/retrospectives/2019/07/#slowing-down-on-the-email-tool-for-copywriters).
