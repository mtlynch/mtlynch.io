# One-Line Summary

Struggling to decide where my focus should be.

# Highlights

* I launched my [task journaling app](https://whatgotdone.com), but it hasn't attracted many users.
* Interviewing potential customers gave me a good idea for my next project.
* I earned $107 from [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) and $123 from [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) without working on either.

# Goal Grades

### Publish a minimum viable product version of What Got Done

* **Result**: What Got Done is now [live](https://whatgotdone.com).
* **Grade**: A

I launched What Got Done on [May 24th](https://whatgotdone.com/michael/2019-05-24). It hasn't gained much traction, so I'm debating whether to stick with it or focus on other ideas.

### Meet with 10 potential customers for my next product

* **Result**: Had five customer meetings (<font color="red">50% below target</font>)
* **Grade**: C

I got a bit sidetracked in adding post-launch features to What Got Done, so I had fewer customer interviews than I intended. It's hard to motivate myself to do the necessary-but-unglamorous work of user research when it's so enticing to add features to a fresh product.

### Publish a new blog post

* **Result**: Published ["How to Grow Quickly and Never Turn a Profit"](/keep-growing-never-profit/) on the last day of the month
* **Grade**: B+

I did publish the blog post, but I had to scramble a bit to get it in under the deadline I set for myself. I'm still trying to strike a balance between rushing posts out the door and spending 40 hours editing and re-editing a single post.

# Inactive projects

### Is It Keto

Now that Is It Keto is on the backburner, I'm not going to dive as deeply into its metrics, but here's a summary of the most interesting ones:

| Metric                 | May 2019   | June 2019   | Change |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $107.25    | $184.25     | <font color="green">+$77.00 (+72%)</font> |
| Unique Visitors        | 10,984     | 14,419      | <font color="green">+3,435 (+31%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 28,751     | 39,405      | <font color="green">+10,654 (+37%)</font> |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | 6          | 6           | 0 |
| Ranking Keywords (Moz) | 949        | 862         | <font color="red">-87 (-9%)</font> |

It's exciting to see that the site is still growing even though I stopped working on it in March. The growth comes entirely from [delayed gains](/keep-growing-never-profit/#search-engines-have-a-substantial-lag) in search engine rankings.

# Suddenly everyone wants to parse ingredients

[Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com), the ingredient parsing service I built last year, earned $123.85 of revenue in May. That's the first time its monthly earnings have been more than a couple of dollars.

Almost the full amount comes from a single customer who needed Zestful for a one-time project, so it's unlikely to repeat for long, but it's fun to get a bit of money back on a project that [cost me ~$8k](/solo-developer-year-1/#zestful).

I raised prices by 566%. If we're going to have a conversation, it should be about thousands of dollars not tens of dollars.

# A brief experiment with display ads on Is It Keto

Ezoic added $45.49 based on 5,452 unique visitors, so they were paying out about $8 per 1,000 visitors.
