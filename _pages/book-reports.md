I try to read as much as possible. This is a way for me to share what I've been reading and forces me to think more deliberately about what I take from each book. Derek Sivers' [keeps public book notes](https://sivers.org/book) provided strong inspiration for these reports.

Given how much urban design affects our lives, it's surprising how little we think about and participate in it. This book was eye-opening in terms of the way I look at cities and how its inhabitants interact with them.

I took for granted the idea that cities should be friendly to car-travel, but the book highlights many ways in which a focus on car-friendliness makes cities worse overall. It was interesting to see examples of how cities can flourish when they prioritize the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit.

This is probably a book that was groundbreaking in 2004, but its ideas have permeated into the mainstream now. In 2018, the ideas don't feel novel or original. [*Thinking Fast and Slow*](https://amzn.to/2oXDdaZ) covers the same material with more depth and better writing.
