        For the past five years, I've wanted to write a book to capture all the
        techniques for effective writing that bring readers to my blog.
      </p>

      <p>My book will teach you how to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create clear and pleasant
          <a
            href="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/"
            >software tutorials</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>Write effective emails</li>
        <li>Minimize pain in writing design documents</li>
        <li>Overcome writer's block</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm raising money on Kickstarter until March 31, 2025 to see if there
        are enough readers for a book like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the book sounds interesting to you, consider pre-ordering a copy.
