        I'm writing a book to capture all the techniques for effective writing
        that I've learned in my fifteen years as a professional software
        developer and blogger.
      </p>

      <p>My book will teach you how to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create clear and pleasant

        </li>
        <li>Write effective emails</li>
        <li>Minimize pain in writing design documents</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm raising money on Kickstarter until March 31, 2025 to see if there
        are enough readers for a book like this.

        If the book sounds interesting to you, consider pre-ordering a copy.
