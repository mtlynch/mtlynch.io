    <em>Refactoring English: Effective Writing for Software Developers</em>
  </h2>

  <p>
    I'm writing a book to capture all the techniques for effective writing that
    I've learned in my fifteen years as a professional software developer and
    frequent writer.
  </p>

  <p>My book will teach you how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Write effective emails</li>
    <li>Create clear and pleasant software tutorials</li>
    <li>Minimize pain in writing design documents</li>
    <li>Overcome writer's block</li>
  </ul>
