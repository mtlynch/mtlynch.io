      <p>
        I'm writing a book to capture all the techniques for effective writing
        that I've learned in my fifteen years as a professional software
        developer and frequent writer.
      </p>

      <p>My book will teach you how to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create clear and pleasant software tutorials</li>
        <li>Write effective emails</li>
        <li>Minimize pain in writing design documents</li>
        <li>Overcome writer's block</li>
      </ul>
