  This Jekyll partial is forked and customized from the parent theme.  The
  partial is used in displaying custom collection index pages and determines
  what field to sort the collection on and in what direction.

  ***NOTE: The parent theme explicitly allows for sorting on either date or
  title.  The customization of this partial includes the ability to sort on
  additional post fields.  If this customization is accepted upstream in the
  parent theme, then this file can be removed.
